      "description": "Another calm, slow and soothing relaxdaily background music instrumental. This smooth and peaceful music arrangement with piano and electric guitar has the power to help you get into a relaxed mood, but also to activate the creative part of your brain. Try it out: Just close your eyes and start dreaming, thinking, reflecting, or even creating. Or, watch the beautiful pictures of Californias coastline in the Big Sur area in a November. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nRelaxdaily's background music instrumentals; slow, peaceful, atmospheric music that can be used as a soundtrack for multiple activities. Depending on your interest you might use my music in your relaxation music playlist, as yoga music or as meditation music (I know, this is not the ordinary music for meditation, but it works for many people). You might also use it as music while you're studying, doing homework, working (mentally, creatively), reading, writing, while thinking or reflecting, dreaming, reviewing, making future plans. Some use it as „sleep music\" (though there might be better sleep music out there...). Call it chillout, ambient, New Age, instrumental, or background music -- this is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With the relaxdaily project, I try to take a little heat from our (generally) too busy lives. I try to deliver a soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some positive, calming, liberating tunes.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy my music, \r\nMichael (relaxdaily)\r\n\r\nwatch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw6LFQhxu_E\r\nthe ultimate relaxdaily playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE6EB41B485F610A \r\nsubscribe to my channel: http://goo.gl/1KR83\r\nvisit my channel: http://goo.gl/1WLRB\r\n\r\n© 2012 relaxdaily.

Use this one for your yoga, as study music, as music for video, or put it into a different playlist, that makes sense to you.
