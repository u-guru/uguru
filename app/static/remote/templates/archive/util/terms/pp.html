    personally identifiable information when you use the site. We only ask site users
    to submit the minimum amount of information necessary to use our service. Such information
    may include your name, password, zip code, email address, and phone number for communication
    purposes. Information may be submitted to the Uguru website or via phone or email

    collect information related to your documentation of and payment for tutoring sessions.
    For tutors, we may collect your Social Security number (SSN) or Federal Employer
    Identification number (FEIN) for tax purposes or to complete a background check.
    As detailed in the "Data Transmission and Storage" section below, we use Secure
    Socket Layer (SSL) encryption on any page of the site where we ask you to submit
    personally identifiable information and encrypt all such information for safe storage
    in our system.

    We also gather non-personally identifiable information when you use the site. Such
    data is compiled in aggregate and includes things like the referring URL and the

    Uguru is committed to keeping your information private and secure. We use industry-standard
    128-bit SSL encryption when collecting and transmitting your information through
    the system. Once information has been collected, we encrypt sensitive data in our
    database for added security. Uguru also uses firewalls and hardware monitoring
    across our system to protect against unauthorized access.

    If you elect to pay for tutoring lessons with a credit card, we will collect your
    name, credit card number, expiration date, and address information associated with
    the account. All financial information is collected securely and encrypted in our
    system in full compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
    (PCI DSS).
</p>
<p>
    If you are a tutor and elect to pay for a background check, we will collect credit
    card information to order a background check on your behalf. Payment information
    entered into our system solely to procure a background check will not be stored
    on our servers.
