This directory contains a special headless configuration of the Tor
Browser app, intended for use by meek-client-torbrowser and the
meek-http-helper extension. It should not be run directly.

All files in the Contents directory, other than Info.plist, are simply
symlinked to their counterparts in ../../../../../Contents. Info.plist
contains an additional configuration directive that prevents the
headless browser from opening a useless second dock icon:
	<key>LSBackgroundOnly</key><true/>

For background on this matter, see the ticket:
