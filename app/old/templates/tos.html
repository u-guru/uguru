  <p>
  These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Uguru.me website and services ("Site") provided by Uguru.me, Inc. ("Uguru.me").

By using or continuing to use the Site, you represent and warrant that you understand, agree to, and accept all terms and conditions contained in this document.<p>
  <p>Uguru.me provides this Site to users seeking tutoring services (“Students”) and to users seeking to provide tutoring services (“Tutors”), and to any other entity on whose behalf users accept these Terms (collectively "you"). These Terms are entered into by and between Uguru.me and you, and you accept them by: (a) contracting for tutoring lessons through the Site; (b) using the Site in any other manner; and/or (c) acknowledging agreement with these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Site.<p>
  <p>To the extent that anything in or associated with the Site is in conflict or inconsistent with these Terms, the Terms shall control. Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
  <p>The Site offers a marketplace for those seeking tutoring services to connect with those seeking to provide tutoring services. As independent contractors hired by Students, Tutors control the methods, materials and all aspects of the lessons.
  Students are responsible for selecting the right tutor for their needs. In making hiring decisions, Students should review and investigate each tutor's self-reported credentials, education, and experience, as well as reviews from other students. All tutoring sessions should be supervised by a responsible adult.</p>
  <p>Uguru.me services may not be available in your location, and available services may vary among locations. In addition, Uguru.me will attempt to deliver all correspondence sent via the Site's messaging system. Uguru.me does not, however, guarantee delivery of all messages.</p>
