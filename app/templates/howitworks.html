                <h3><u>Students are tutors, tutors are students</u></h3>
                <p>When you need help you're a student. When you help others you're a tutor. As simple as that. Peer to peer at its finest.</p>
                <h3><u>How we validate tutors</u></h3>
                <p>Every tutor begins at a fresh slate at uGuru.me for every skill they've added. If the quality is good, the rate for that tutor will increase. Any tutor below a certain average (around 3 stars) will be much less promoted.
                  <br><br>
                When a tutor is available to help, a student will see the following attributes:
              </p>
              <em>insert star rating image here</em>
                <h3><u>How our pricing works</u></h3>
                <p>Each tutor begins at a certain rate. With more tutoring encounters through uGuru.me and high ratings, we'll market you at a higher rate. Base price is $7/hour.
                  <br><br>
                We may charge a transaction fee in the future. Right now everything is free, <em>no credit card required!</em>
