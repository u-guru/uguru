			uGuru <strong> helps connect college students with peer tutors (Gurus)</strong> who have done well in the same classes in school

			<br><br>
			We have all experienced that helpless feeling when you are stuck in the library by yourself the night before exams because you can’t find help outside the classroom.
			<br>
			<br>
			Traditional tutoring is too expensive. Office hours are too packed. Why not make it easy for students to get help from each other?
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
			So we created a platform to make peer-to-peer help available and affordable. </strong>

				<span><h3>How is uGuru different comparing to traditional private tutoring?</h3></span>
				<span>{% include "web/components/nav/plus.svg" %}</span>
			</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Traditional private tutoring costs anywhere from $30 to $60 per hour, and that is ridiculously expensive for poor college students living on top ramen. Since it’s student helping each other, sessions on uGuru are super affordable ($15/hr on average).
			<br><br>
			uGuru also focuses on making urgent help available, especially when you are in a jam, and need to cram.
			<br><br>
			Most importantly, students are getting help directly from peer tutors that have done well in the same exact courses at Cal, instead of random “experts” who are not familiar with the students particular course.

			</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Everyone can sign up as a Guru, but you will need to prove yourself before you can start charging your students. You will give free sessions until you receive an average of 4.5 star rating. Most good Gurus can do that in one shot and become an official Guru.

		</dt>
		<dd>
			No time commitment required at all! Signing up to be a guru makes it possible for you to receive work, but you are not obligated to take a job if it doesn’t fit your schedule or if you’re cramming for your own midterm. You set your own schedule based upon which sessions you choose to accept.

			</a>

			The class selection is based upon what courses gurus have signed up to tutor. The larger the course, the more likely a guru has signed up to tutor that course. Currently, the largest selection of gurus are available for lower division courses and for writing help.

				</h3></span>
				<span>{% include "web/components/nav/plus.svg" %}</span>
			</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			uGuru offers personal attention and time flexibility which are often not offered by other resources on campus. With uGuru, students wouldn’t have to worry about competing for the tutor’s time with other students.
			<br>
			<br>
			uGuru tutors are also available at times that are convenient to the student, whether that be on the weekends or late in the night right before a midterm. Overall, it’s easier, and faster.

		<dd>
			Prices vary, but usually around $15 per hour. You name your own price when you request help, and Gurus also get to reply with their ideal price. We also provide recommended rates depending on the time of the semester (ex: a higher offer helps you attract Gurus during Finals season).

			After each payment through the platform, students give the Guru a review and a rating, which will be appear on the Guru’s profile to help other students compare their options.

			Since our Gurus are awesome, it is common that students would like to have more sessions with the same Guru after the first time.
