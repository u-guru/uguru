            <h5>What is Uguru?</h5>

            <p>Uguru is a peer-to-peer student platform that connects you with a tutor based on your location. For example, if you're struggling with biology at UCLA, then we automatically pair you up with a tutor who is a biology wiz at UCLA.<p>

            <h5>What makes your tutors better?</h5>

            <p>Our tutors, also known as gurus, are socially rated by previous students who worked with them. We also choose our gurus based on their current GPA, what they excel at, and how active they are on Uguru. We then match you up with a guru who best fits your needs.</p>


            <h5>When can I grab a guru?</h5>

            <p>You can get a guru at any time, on any day. Because this is a peer-to-peer platform, there is no such thing as open and close times. If you're struggling with homework at two in the morning, then all you need to do is request help, and you'll get it ASAP.</p>


            <h5>Where do I meet my guru?</h5>

            <p>You have the freedom to meet your guru anywhere you'd like. If you're more comfortable meeting them at a coffee shop, then simply drag location pin to your favorite coffee shop. If you're okay with them coming over to your place, then drag the pin over your house or dorm. </p>


            <h5>What if I'm not satisfied with my guru?</h5>

            <p>If you're not satisfied with your guru in some way, then you can give them a rating that reflects that, and you can contact us to get a refund right away. Our goal is to make sure that you succeed in your classes. Whether it's memorizing, learning skill-sets, or building confidence.</p>

            <h5>How do I become a guru?</h5>

            <p>You can become a guru by going to Settings then clicking on 'Become a Guru'. Or alternatively, you can sign up to be a guru by <a href="">clicking here</a>.
