                          <li> <strong>Follow best practices</strong>. Learn from the experts online or relative to you (maybe me). Do not be stubborn and do what you think is right (or at least propose first). That only takes steps backward.
                          </li>
                          <li> Your mentality should be to <strong> be the best in your field </strong>

                          <li> <strong> 100% energy levels MUST BE existent </strong> when you come in to work. Negative energy is extremely contagious.

                          <li> During the times you are working on Uguru, <strong> put the company before yourself </strong>. Basically, follow best practices versus what you think.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong> Complete transparency </strong> - do not hesitate to tell me what is bothering you or what is going on. Consequences will always be worse if I find out on my own.
                          </li>
                          <li> <strong> Breaks can be useful </strong> , but need to be justifiable. Anything over 15 minutes requires approval.

                          <li> <strong> Clean up </strong> after yourselves
