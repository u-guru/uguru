	Since the desktop version only has a <section> since its CTA only, we might as well try to inherit it here like we did with the original student home--><div class="modal"><ion-modal-view><div id="request-price" ng-include="img_base + BASE + 'templates/essay.student.request.html'"></div></ion-modal-view></div>
