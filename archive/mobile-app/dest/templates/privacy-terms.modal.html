(“Uguru“) operates several websites including uguru.me as well as the Uguru Android and iOS app. This privacy policy specifically relates to the Uguru and the Uguru Android and iOS applications (collectively “Uguru“). It is Uguru’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and applications.</p></div><div><h4 class="semibold">Website Visitors and App Users</h4><p>Like most website and app operators, Uguru collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Uguru's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Uguru's visitors and customers use its products. From time to time, Uguru may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its services.</p></div><div><h4 class="semibold">Gathering of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p>Certain users or visitors of Uguru choose to interact with Uguru in ways that require Uguru to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Uguru gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask customers who sign up for an account within the Uguru mobile applications to provide an email address.</p><p>In each case, Uguru collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with Uguru. Uguru does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website and app-related activities.</p></div><div><h4 class="semibold">Aggregated Statistics</h4><p>Uguru may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and users of its iOS and Android applications. For instance, Uguru will monitor usage of meditations as well as the information entered by users as part of their self-assessment “check-in” process. Uguru may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Uguru does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p></div><div><h4 class="semibold">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p>Uguru discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Uguru’s behalf or to provide services available on Uguru, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Uguru, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p><p>Uguru will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Uguru discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Uguru believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Uguru, third parties or the public at large.</p><p>If you have supplied your email address, Uguru may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Uguru. We primarily use our various blogs and social media accounts to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p><p>Uguru takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p></div><div><h4 class="semibold">Privacy Policy Changes</h4><p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Uguru may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Uguru’s sole discretion. Uguru encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p></div></ion-content></section></ion-modal-view>
