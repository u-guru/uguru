00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,730
PROFESSOR: Good morning. Today's lecture begins
what is probably conceptually the

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,640
most difficult topic that we're going to be
presenting in this portion of the class on

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,210
plants. Is this loud enough? It is on. Can
you make the microphone louder? I'm sorry

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,450
my voice is a bit ... how about now? Better?
Good. All right.

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,870
So with today's lecture what we do is we begin
a discussion of what is conceptually

6
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:41,149
probably the most difficult topic presented
in the class portion on plants.

7
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,940
Today we're going to talk about water relations
in plants. And in order to help you

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,399
understand this topic and to appreciate it,
and in order to make sure that you understand

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,159
it for the class, we have several aids. The
first is that next week your lab is going

10
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,109
to

11
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,929
stress water relations. You're going to be
doing some of the experiments that we talk

12
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:07,130
about today. And that hopefully will help
you solidify some of these rather abstract

13
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:07,960
concepts.

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,930
Also we're giving you a problem set for the
fourth lab. This problem set is exactly

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,960
the same problem set as we've given out in
previous years. It is, you could easily just

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,330
copy the answers from somebody who took the
class last year. But my hope is and

17
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,390
suggestion is that you don't do that. Use
the problem set as a way of telling yourself

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,020
whether or not you really understand water
relations. This is the time to solidify those

19
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,560
concepts in your mind because you won't have
an opportunity later on once you get into

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,250
ecology and evolution to make sure that you
understand the material.

21
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,520
So make sure that you take advantage of the
problem set. They are not hard. They're

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,700
to help you to convince you that you do or
do not understand water relations.

23
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,900
Now of the processes that are unique to plants,
probably the most unique one, of

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,180
course, is photosynthesis. But running a close
second as far as the processes that go on

25
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,550
in plants and that are unique to them is the
transport of water over very great distances

26
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,120
of the plant. For example, to the top of a
redwood tree, without the aid of any kind

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,720
of a

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,200
pump, any kind of mechanical system. And today
what we want to do is to talk about this

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,700
very unique process, to talk about the mechanism
by which water is moved great distances

30
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,540
in plants without the aid of any kind of mechanical
instrumentation.

31
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,470
And at the outset I want to mention to you
that when we talk about water relations

32
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,030
and water movement which is what we'll be
talking about today, the concepts and the

33
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,780
equations which apply to this particular physiological
reaction apply to water movement in

34
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,310
all living systems, in your bodies, in insects,
in fish. So although you may say that

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,290
this is vague and it's not something you're
going to see again, if any of you go on to

36
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,770
animal physiology or into medicine, you want
to understand how the kidney works, it

37
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,160
follows exactly the same sorts of principles
that we're going to discuss today.

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,060
In order for us to appreciate water movement
in the plant, we have to divide the

39
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:14,060
topic into two sub-portions. And the first
portion is the properties of the water

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
molecule. And the second property or discussion
point that we want to talk about is the

41
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,480
nature of the plumbing system.

42
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,050
And I'd like to begin by discussing properties
of the water molecule that are

43
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,910
important. And for this demonstration, for
this first topic I want to do a slight

44
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,020
demonstration here for you. And I'm just going
to pour some pure water into this

45
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:57,020
crystalizing dish. And then I'm going to take
this razor blade, which is denser than the

46
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,050
water, and put it on the surface of the water.
And for those of you sitting up here in

47
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,069
front, you'll notice that the razor blade
floats. Even though it's heavier on a per

48
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:09,430
unit

49
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,819
area or per square weight area than the water,
it stays on the surface of the water.

50
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:20,569
And this property that the water has which
allows the razor blade to float is an

51
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:25,169
important property in understanding water
movement in plants.

52
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:32,169
This property is called surface tension. And
on a molecular level if we look at the

53
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,970
water molecule, the basis of surface tension
rests on the fact that in the water molecule

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,310
the electrons tend to spend more time around
the oxygen than they do around the hydrogens.

55
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,410
And so there's an overall more negative charge
around the oxygens. And a more positive

56
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:09,410
charge around the hydrogens. And this results
then in the development of a bond that most

57
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,130
of you have already had introduced to you
either in high school chemistry or introductory

58
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,130
chemistry here known as a hydrogen bond.

59
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,310
This allows for the surface of the water to
support the blade, the surface tension.

60
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,650
We sometimes say that the water is sticky,
that is the water molecules stick to each

61
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,580
other, or a more technical term which you
will see used in the textbook is that it

62
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,669
illustrates cohesion. Cohesion is a property
of the water molecule.

63
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:50,210
So the first property that we want to keep
in mind is that water molecules exhibit

64
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,650
cohesion. And they can form hydrogen bonds
between individual molecules.

65
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,229
The second property which we want to talk
about with regard to water molecules is

66
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:06,229
that water evaporates, that is it goes from
a liquid to a gas phase. And the speed with

67
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:23,419
which water evaporates, the rapidity, depends
on the temperature and on the humidity.

68
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,680
And knowing the temperature and humidity in
any particular environment, one can

69
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,680
calculate a number for how rapidly water will
evaporate. And that number gives us a value

70
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:57,690
which is known as the vapor pressure gradient.
A value for helping us to understand how

71
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:07,979
rapidly evaporation will occur, how quickly
water will go from a liquid to a gas state.

72
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:14,139
Now having discussed these two molecular properties
of the water molecule, I want to

73
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:21,139
now discuss with you three principles which
govern water movement. And we'll write them

74
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,949
out, and then we'll discuss each of them individually.

75
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:42,949
The first principle is known as mass flow.
The second principle which we need to

76
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:51,710
understand in order to appreciate how water
gets up to the top of tall trees is diffusion.

77
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:00,500
And the third principle, probably the most
familiar to you of the three, is osmosis.

78
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:08,370
Let's begin with mass flow by defining it.
And what we will say is mass flow is

79
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,160
movement of water from a region of higher
concentration 

80
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,289
to a region of lower

81
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:38,289
concentration.

82
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,410
Now what do I mean by higher concentration
and lower concentration of water? Here I

83
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,570
have two beakers. And I'm going to just take
this pure water and pour some into each of

84
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:03,570
these two beakers. So there's nothing else
in this beaker except water molecules.

85
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,660
And now into one of these beakers, let's say
the one here on the left, I'm going to

86
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:16,500
add some table sugar or salt to the beaker.
And we're going to dissolve this table salt

87
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,500
or the sugar in the beaker. And now if I could
magically dissolve the two walls

88
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,240
separating these two liquid solutions -- that
is the pure water and the water which now

89
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,120
contains the sugar -- so that the water on
the two beakers can now flow together, what

90
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,370
we

91
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:44,190
would find is that water would flow from where
it is more pure to where it is less pure.

92
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:51,130
It is going from where it is more concentrated
to where it is less concentrated. So

93
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:58,130
in this particular beaker, we have more than
just water dissolved in the beaker. We have

94
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:04,180
salts or sugars, whatever it is we put into
the beaker. So water moves from where it is

95
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,890
more concentrated to a region where it's less
concentrated or from where it is pure to a

96
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,800
region where it is less pure. Very important
point for you to understand.

97
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Now the potential of water to move 
can be measured. And when we make this

98
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,050
measurement -- and we're going to be doing
that in the lab and we'll talk about it some

99
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:46,050
more -- we call this potential, we call it
the water potential. Potential to move, it's

100
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:57,310
called the water potential.

101
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,190
And it is indicated by the Greek letter psi.
This is the way you will have it in

102
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,130
your lab notes and in the lab next week.

103
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:14,130
Now, I want to take you to another system
because I want you to understand how we put

104
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:22,610
numbers on the water potential. When we measure
temperature, arbitrarily we set the

105
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,640
freezing point of water as zero degrees centigrade.
Everything else is compared to zero

106
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,140
degrees centigrade. So we have a reference
point in the temperature to which we compare

107
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,570
everything else.

108
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,089
We have the same type of reference point for
water relations. And that reference

109
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:45,089
point is pure water. So we arbitrarily say
that the water potential of pure water, that

110
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,540
is nothing else is dissolved in this beaker,
the only molecules present in this beaker

111
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:51,790
are

112
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,760
water molecules, we arbitrarily set the water
potential of pure water as equal to zero.

113
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,760
So the psi of pure water equals zero. Important
point. And what this means, which

114
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:15,100
is the confusing part, it means anything dissolved
in water lowers the water potential.

115
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,079
And this translates into a negative number.

116
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,850
Now we can measure water potential. And as
I said we're going to be doing it in the

117
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,800
lab in the class. And there are various units
which are attached to it, depending upon

118
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,240
whether you're a biologist or a chemist or
a physicist. Some of the units you will see

119
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,240
attached are bars, atmospheres. Again, it
depends upon which discipline you're in

120
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,180
depending upon which units we actually attach
to the water potential number.

121
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:14,180
Aside from being able to measure the water
potential, we can also measure how much of

122
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,180
the contaminating species is dissolved in
the water. And this species, in this particular

123
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:27,180
case salt, can be more than just sodium chloride.
It can be many salts. And so we give a

124
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:34,769
name to all the species which are dissolved
in the water and we call them solutes.

125
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:41,769
Solutes represent the total of all the species
that are dissolved in the water.

126
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,880
And we can measure the total number of species
dissolved. And we indicate that total

127
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,880
number dissolved by again the Greek letter
psi. And depending upon again which book

128
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:12,990
you're using or which notation, it's equally,
it's sometimes indicated psi sub-pi or your

129
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:20,079
textbook indicates it as psi sub- s for solutes.
And this represents then the total

130
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,680
value of solutes. And again it has the same
units that we talked about before.

131
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:38,310
So these represent then important aspects
of the dissolving of solutes in the water.

132
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,240
Now having introduced you to these particular
concepts here, what I want to do now is

133
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:54,060
to return to the second of the two principles
we talked about, namely, to talk about

134
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:01,060
diffusion.

135
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,940
And we can define diffusion as the overall
movement of water or, it doesn't have to

136
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,860
be water, just overall movement of a species,
it could be more, from a region of high

137
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,519
concentration to lower concentration until
the distribution is equal throughout 
the

138
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:58,199
system.

139
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,180
And when we get this equal distribution throughout
the system of whatever the ion is

140
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:12,180
or species we're looking at or solid is, we
say we reach equilibrium. And for this

141
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:27,660
discussion we can say that when the diffusing
ion or diffusing species let's say is water,

142
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:41,680
then mass flow and diffusion are the same.

143
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:59,260
And to illustrate this point I have here some
blue dye which is very concentrated in

144
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,220
this dropper bottle. And if I introduce this
dye into this particular beaker at one

145
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,409
portion of the beaker, the dye is going to
now diffuse from where it is most

146
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:16,869
concentrated -- namely, the drop -- over time
so that its concentration is equal

147
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,549
throughout the entire beaker. And at that
point we will say that the species, in this

148
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:27,859
case the blue dye, is in equilibrium with
the solution that it's dissolved in. An

149
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,029
pointer.

150
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:35,859
Finally I want to mention to you the third,
third aspect of the principles which

151
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:42,859
govern water movement. And that third aspect
is osmosis. And this is something which

152
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:51,029
you're going to explore in the lab and perhaps
some of you have already done so in your

153
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,929
high school biology classes.

154
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:59,929
So we're going to talk about osmosis. And
what we can define osmosis as it is the

155
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:08,409
diffusion of water through -- and for water
we could also put other solutes if you want

156
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:13,629
to

157
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,440
use them, but normally it's water -- diffusion
of water through a selectively permeable

158
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:30,809
membrane.

159
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,629
And this can be shown, and you're going to
do this in the class, by the construction

160
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:44,629
of a device known as an osmometer. And let's
just look at the main elements of the

161
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,090
osmometer, which again you're going to make
in class.

162
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:58,789
So for this particular example of the osmometer
we'll have a beaker which contains

163
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:05,789
pure water. So because the water is pure,
the psi equals zero. And into this beaker

164
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:15,759
we're going to introduce a tube like so. And
this tube then is going to have at one end

165
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:18,729
a

166
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:25,489
selectively permeable membrane. It's going
to be attached securely, as you will do in

167
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:31,679
the

168
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,809
lab, selectively permeable membrane to one
end of the tube.

169
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:42,809
Then into this tube you're going to introduce
water plus some solute. So that means

170
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,960
that the water potential of the solution you're
introducing, the water potential is some

171
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,960
negative number. Everybody clear on that?

172
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,850
So again, following the basic principles of
water moving from where it is in higher

173
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:15,200
concentration to where it is in lower concentration,
and given that the selectively

174
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,220
permeable membrane if this particular experiment
only allows water to move through it, not

175
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:27,220
our solute, we would expect that water would
go from where it is more concentrated to

176
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:32,769
where it is less concentrated. That is it
would move into the tube, and you can measure

177
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:38,599
the force moving into the tube by the rise
in the water column in the osmometer.

178
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:43,429
So this is an experiment which you will conduct
in the lab. And again it is meant to

179
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:49,019
illustrate for you one of the main principles
that we have to consider with regard to

180
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,779
water relations, water movement in all living
organisms.

181
00:20:53,779 --> 00:21:00,330
Now what I'd like to do is to switch the topic
slightly and to talk about the other

182
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:07,330
aspect of the water movement and that is to
talk about the plumbing system; that is the

183
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:14,989
pathway that water follows. So we're going
to talk about the plumbing system.

184
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:21,029
And we're going to draw a couple of these
elements on the plumbing system for us to

185
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:28,029
use. And in this particular case we're going
to start out with the stem which you,

186
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:36,749
nothing that's going to be any new to you.
We have the root system. And we have the

187
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:50,539
leaf. And then we want to add a few more elements
onto this particular drawing so we can

188
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,440
begin to appreciate the water movement.

189
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,440
One element that we want to add are the stomata.
And recall we said the stomata

190
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:11,169
CO2 enters and water leaves. Or water evaporates.

191
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:25,789
The only other element we need to add to this
drawing is the cell type, which in the

192
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:32,970
stem transports the water, and that's the
xylem which we said, depending upon whether

193
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:33,259
it

194
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:40,169
was a gymnosperm or an angiosperm, consists
of tracheids and vessels or vessel elements.

195
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:50,109
Now, in order for us to look at this cartoon
and to put it together with the

196
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:55,309
principles of water movement, I want to give
you a statement which we're going to explore

197
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:01,599
in more detail but one which forms the basis
of understanding water movement in the plant.

198
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:08,599
And that statement is that the driving force
for water movement in plants is the

199
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:27,659
evaporation of water from the surface of the
leaf.

200
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,539
Now I'd like to explore this statement a little
more with the principles that we have

201
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:46,029
and with this cartoon that we have drawn over
here. And for this discussion what I'd like

202
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:52,729
to do is to put some real numbers for water
potential on the various aspects of the

203
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:54,149
plumbing system.

204
00:23:54,149 --> 00:24:01,059
The first is to give you a real number for
the water potential of the atmosphere.

205
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:05,820
That is, how much water is dissolved in the
atmosphere. There are lots of other things

206
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,070
in

207
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,109
the atmosphere. So realistic number around
here for the water potential for the

208
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:17,109
atmosphere would be maybe -20. Now how about,
what would be a realistic number for the

209
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:25,149
water potential of the leaf? The leaf is a
living system. It has membranes. It has

210
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:32,200
salts which are part of the living system.
So a reasonable value for the water potential

211
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:39,299
inside the leaf might be a psi equal of -8.

212
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:44,739
And then we'll talk about these other two
aspects of the water system in a moment.

213
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:50,129
Now let's look at just following the water
potential equations that we talked about

214
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:55,779
before, what's going to happen to a water
molecule? As a water molecule comes to the

215
00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:01,349
surface of the leaf and is exposed to the
atmosphere, it is at a water potential of

216
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:03,179
-8

217
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,969
compared to the water potential of the atmosphere
of -20 where there's less concentration

218
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:08,609
of water.

219
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,149
Yes?

220
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:10,219
STUDENT: [inaudible]

221
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:14,599
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? Units are whatever ones
you want to use. Again, depending

222
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,119
upon whether you're a physicist, a mathematician
or whatever. Doesn't make any

223
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,960
difference. It's the same principles.

224
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,359
STUDENT: [inaudible]

225
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:28,009
PROFESSOR: -8 bars, -8 atmospheres, -8 Pascal's,
again it just depends upon what

226
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:30,929
you're coming from as far as discipline.

227
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:37,099
So here we have a -8 inside the leaf compared
to a -20 in the atmosphere. And so now

228
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:42,889
the water is going to want to go from where
it is more concentrated or pure to where it

229
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:43,139
is

230
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:49,950
less concentrated. And at this point the water
leaves the leaf. And when it leaves the

231
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:54,159
leaf, it evaporates. It breaks the hydrogen
bonds.

232
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:01,159
So, the evaporation of water from the leaf
is the starting point for the mechanism.

233
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,440
And we call this evaporation of water from
the leaf transpiration. Transpiration. Now

234
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:19,489
let's see what happens as this water is beginning
to evaporate from the leaf, it is still

235
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:25,960
attached to other water molecules in this
particular stem. And they now are beginning

236
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,210
to

237
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:30,919
come under tension. The bonds between, the
hydrogen bonds between the adjacent water

238
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,379
molecules are beginning to stretch. And you
can kind of indicate it with this rubber band

239
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:40,109
with these yellow things meant to indicate
the water molecules.

240
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:45,599
Here we are in the xylem of the tree and now
transpiration is occurring. And as

241
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:52,599
transpiration occurs, a tension is applied
to the bonds and they begin to stretch. They

242
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:59,960
begin to stretch like so. And this stretching
essentially pulls the water molecules up

243
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,099
the tree. So the driving force for the movement
of water up to the tree is the fact that

244
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:12,559
evaporation is causing a buildup of tension.
And this tension is lifting the whole column

245
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,779
of water in the tree.

246
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:19,960
Until it reaches the point where the tension
is so great at this region over here

247
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,489
that the hydrogen bonds break and the water
molecule evaporates. So very important point.

248
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:32,589
Now we can measure this tension which develops
inside the tree as a result of the

249
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:39,589
water evaporating. And it is indicated, a
measure of the tension is indicated by the

250
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:52,279
Greek letter psi sub-p. Measure of tension
that develops inside. And it is a negative

251
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:59,499
number. A negative number.

252
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:07,129
We can actually measure this tension with
a number of instruments. And I brought 1

253
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:12,190
of these instruments into the lecture today.
I hope some of you come up and look at it.

254
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,229
And this instrument measures tension in a
very unique way.

255
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:23,229
First of all let me describe the instrument
to you. It is called the Scholander

256
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:31,849
pressure chamber. And it consists of the following:
It consists of a heavily

257
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:41,419
thick-walled pressure chamber, like so, which
is connected to a meter. And this meter is

258
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:53,399
then connected to a gas, a cylinder of compressed
gas. This is the Scholander pressure

259
00:28:56,589 --> 00:29:03,589
bomb used for measuring tension.

260
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:13,779
Now how does this work? Here's a plant which
I cut yesterday. And during the time,

261
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,399
although it's been in water, if I had taken
it out of water and let it sit in the lab,

262
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:26,399
this plant would have been transpiring. The
water molecules in this particular plant

263
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:34,109
would be in a condition of high tension. So
here we have a stem which has been

264
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:41,989
transpiring all night. And here are the water
molecules, and they're really stretched

265
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:48,989
between each other because they're under high
tension. High tension.

266
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:57,330
How do we measure that tension? If I take
these cutters here and I cut the stem like

267
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:06,249
so, so we have now these two parts of the
stem, what does this do to the water column?

268
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:07,059
So

269
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:12,690
here is the stem now which has been cut. And
now what we've done is we've severed the

270
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,969
water column and we've released the tension.

271
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:22,969
So the water molecules now pull back from
the cut surface with very little space

272
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:28,679
between the individual water molecules. Tension
has been released.

273
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,830
Now, so that's these two parts over here now.

274
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:38,249
Now how does the pressure bomb work? The pressure
bomb works by taking in this

275
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:45,249
particular case this top shoot system and
putting it into the top of the chamber which

276
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:46,279
is

277
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:53,279
over here like so. So I put the, with the
end of the stem sticking out. And it's, this

278
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,639
is usually tightened down. I increase the
gas pressure. And now what I'm going to ask

279
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:00,339
is

280
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:07,339
how much pressure do I have to put on this
plant here to push the water back to the point

281
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,639
that it was at before I cut the stem?

282
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:17,869
We read that number off of this dial here.
And that gives us a measure of how much

283
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:22,450
positive pressure we have to put in to restore
the water column back to the point that it

284
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:28,389
was prior to the time that I cut it. That
number is a positive number. And now because

285
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:34,289
the plant is under tension, in order for us
to get a reading as to what is going on, we

286
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:41,289
have to now give you a negative number in
order for the tension to be given a real value.

287
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:48,009
So tension is indicated by a negative number.

288
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:55,009
Anybody have any questions? This is an important
concept. Tension or psi sub-p is

289
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:05,049
a negative number. Yes.

290
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,739
STUDENT: [inaudible]

291
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:14,190
PROFESSOR: The Scholander pressure chamber
is set up exactly as we have it here,

292
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,849
except there's a small tank of pressurized
gas which I didn't bring in. And the great

293
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:22,019
part about this pressurized chamber is it's
portable. People who are physiologic

294
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:26,489
ecologists can take this into the field with
them and can actually do measurements of

295
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:30,549
plants in their actual site. You can tell
how much tension a plant is under because

296
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,799
these

297
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:32,299
chambers are portable.

298
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:35,820
Any other questions? Okay.

299
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:42,669
Now, having talked to you a little bit about
water relations and at least these three

300
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:48,999
components -- psi sub-pi, psi sub-p, and psi
-- which affect water movement, what I'd

301
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:55,049
like to do is to move on now to talking to
you about some real situations with regard

302
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:55,899
to

303
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:58,830
water molecules and with regard to water movement.

304
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,419
And the situation which I'd like to discuss
with you is one that we have allude to

305
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:10,419
for much of the class. Namely, what I'd like
to discuss with you is the control of pore

306
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:18,899
size in stomata via changes. So water is distributed
throughout the plant. And it's

307
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:37,019
destruction does many things. It carries along
with it nutrients. It removes nutrients

308
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,889
from photosynthate to take them to storage
organs. But water is also used in many other

309
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,029
processes.

310
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:48,239
And I'd like to discuss with you some of the
other processes that water is used in.

311
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:54,219
And the one I'd like to begin with is the
guard cell or stomata situation of which we

312
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:54,469
have

313
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:59,869
talked about already quite a lot.

314
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:06,869
So let's begin by drawing for you a typical
stomatal setup, which as we said consists

315
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:14,149
of a pore and two guard cells. And what we
said over here is that the size of the pore

316
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:25,980
is

317
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:32,819
important in determining whether or not CO2
can enter and water can leave. And what we

318
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:40,470
want to explore now is the fact that the size
of the pore is controlled by water or more

319
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,849
abstractly by water potential.

320
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:58,549
Now in order to appreciate how this works,
so in some circumstances the pore is open.

321
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:04,029
And now in the other circumstance which we
have also illustrated before and I'll show

322
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:04,640
you

323
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,410
some slides of this in a moment, in this other
circumstance, the pore can be closed, a

324
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:18,410
closed pore. And we have the guard cells again
surrounding this closed pore.

325
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,410
How do we go from these two particular states
and how is this related to water? In

326
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:28,150
order for you to appreciate this I'm going
to show you some slide of it because it's

327
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,400
a

328
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,200
hard concept to do. You have to know two facts.

329
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,109
The first fact is that the guard cells, which
I'll just abbreviate as GC, are

330
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:47,109
tightly attached to each other 

331
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:59,789
at their ends. And the second fact which is,
of course,

332
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:05,960
something we have referred to a number of
times in talking about different cell types

333
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,559
is

334
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:13,559
that the guard cells are alive. That is they
have a membrane. So each of these cells has

335
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:27,430
a membrane surrounding it.

336
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:35,170
So let's now follow the steps in moving from
a closed pore as illustrated above to an

337
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,480
open pore. What goes on?

338
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,480
So in going from closed to open, how does
this happen? Well let me tell you what the

339
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,990
endpoint is in order for this to happen and
then we'll say how we got there. The endpoint

340
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:59,990
is that pressure has to increase in the guard
cell.

341
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:10,019
How does this pressure increase? Number one,
solutes moved into the guard cells. So

342
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:23,390
across that membrane we now move solutes.
Number two, the water potential of the guard

343
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:31,869
cells becomes more negative. And number three,
water enters the guard cell causing an

344
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,720
increase in pressure and opening of the pore.

345
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:15,279
Let's look at this increase in pressure inside
the guard cell as a result of water

346
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:22,279
coming in. So here's our pore. Here is one
of the guard cells with its membrane. And

347
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:33,760
now the pore is open because water has come
in and increased the pressure. So water has

348
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:42,250
moved in to the guard cells. Water in. And
as a result, pressure inside rises.

349
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:56,390
So water is coming in, and now pressure inside
the guard cells is increasing. And

350
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:02,670
that pressure is pushing out on the walls
of the guard cell as more water comes in.

351
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:08,049
Think of it as a balloon. As you're blowing
more air into the balloon, the balloon

352
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:13,140
is inflating more. Think of the wall of the
balloon as the cell wall or the membrane.

353
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,950
And think of the air as water.

354
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:22,950
This pressure inside is a positive pressure.
And we call this positive pressure

355
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:40,650
turgor pressure. And we can measure it. And
it is illustrated by the sign psi sub-p

356
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,519
again.

357
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:55,519
So in turgor pressure, psi sub-p is positive
in turgor pressure. But in tension,

358
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,400
psi sub-p is negative. So this symbol psi
sub-p can be either positive or negative,

359
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:25,380
depending upon whether you are in a cell that's
alive with a membrane or a cell that is

360
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,420
dead as the xylem element is.

361
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:35,420
Let's look now at a few pictures of the stomatal
system we've talked about. Okay the

362
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,789
first slide is meant to illustrate for you
what you have seen before. Namely, that we

363
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:45,970
have the epidermis of the leaf where transpiration
is occurring. We have the pore, and on

364
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,240
either side of the pore are the two guard
cells. And I want to again call your

365
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,420
attention -- and we'll look at this more closely
in a cartoon -- to the fact that the

366
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:59,099
guard cells are tightly joined to each other
at their ends. And that when pressure

367
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:03,990
increases, this causes the two cells to push
apart from each other, to bow out. And this

368
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,890
accounts for the opening of the pore.

369
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,900
You can see this joining of the end walls
in this scanning electromicroscope picture

370
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:17,190
of the guard cells where they are attached.
They are very expanded, again because of

371
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:23,529
turgor pressure inside. And this turgor pressure
exists because of the membrane which now

372
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:29,890
allows for solutes to accumulate and for an
increase in water pressure inside.

373
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:36,680
Here we have now the movement of water in
following a movement of solutes. And the

374
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,400
water moving in causes the two cells to bow
out from each other and the pore to open.

375
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,230
When the guard cell closes, we move the solutes
out of the guard cell. And when the

376
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,269
solutes go out, the water potential of the
guard cells becomes more positive relative

377
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:52,519
to

378
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:59,410
the cells outside. And, it becomes more positive,
and the water then leaves or the cells

379
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,319
close.

380
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:05,859
So in this particular case we have a very
nice system which depends upon a simple

381
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,779
change in water potential.

382
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:12,309
Now what is the solute that moves in and out
between these two cells? We now know

383
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:18,190
that the main solute that the cells move across
is potassium. Potassium is the element

384
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:23,259
which changes the water potential which the
plant selectively moves across the guard cell

385
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:28,089
membrane in order to allow the guard cells
to open or close.

386
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:33,490
Now just to use maybe something too much,
here's a cartoon of two balloons meant to

387
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,859
illustrate for you the two guard cells. And
what we've done is to attach the two ballons

388
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:44,730
at their end. And then to ask your graduate
student to blow-up the balloon as if the air

389
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,710
was going in was water. And when you blow-up
the balloons, when they're attached at their

390
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,279
ends, you create this space in between. And
this is the mechanism by which the guard

391
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,579
cells open.

392
00:42:55,579 --> 00:43:02,059
Now finally, what I want to do is to talk
to you a little bit more about turgor

393
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:08,650
pressure. The form of plants, the fact that
when a plant is growing well in your yard

394
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:08,900
and

395
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:13,289
you've watered it, the form of a plant is
due to the fact that a plant has high turgor

396
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:19,029
pressure. When a plant wilts, when it collapses,
it is because you have removed the

397
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:25,220
turgor pressure to a point that it is no longer
pressing against the cells and thereby,

398
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,579
the plant's form changes.

399
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:34,579
And so what I'd like to do is to illustrate
for you a small experiment to look a

400
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:39,819
little more closely at turgor pressure and
to look at one aspect of the turgor pressure

401
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:42,720
that you're going to see in the lab.

402
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,720
And that aspect is the following: We're going
to take a cell which is fully turgid.

403
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:57,910
Fully turgid. That is turgor pressure, turgor
pressure is pushing out. Turgor pressure

404
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:11,990
is pushing out.

405
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:18,660
Now what we're going to do is to take this
cell which is full turgor pressure, and

406
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,460
let's just say for our experiment that we
have here that the water potential, let's

407
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:24,710
just

408
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:30,869
say the water potential of the cell is -4,
just for our discussion. It's got some salts

409
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:34,180
inside. It's got a lot of water inside.

410
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:41,180
And now what we want to do is take this cell
which now has a psi equal to -4, and

411
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:50,769
we're going to put it inside of a beaker in
which we, or series of beakers, where we

412
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,839
change the size. And we make them more negative.

413
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:16,049
So we may have -5, -6, -7. You're actually
going to do this experiment in the lab.

414
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:24,210
And what's happening to this cell if it is
put into a solution which has a water

415
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:31,210
potential more negative than it? Well, water
is more pure inside the cell. It has a

416
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:36,769
higher water potential even though it's a
negative number. So water's going to leave

417
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:37,170
the

418
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,549
cell. Everybody clear on that? It's going
to leave the cell, following the gradient

419
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:40,799
in

420
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,480
psi from where it is more pure to where it
is less pure.

421
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,220
So what we're going to see happening as we
increase the water potential inside the

422
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:55,220
beaker is soon we begin to lose, we have a
loss of psi sub-p or turgor pressure, at

423
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:08,529
which point the cell begins to shrink. It
actually is inflated as a result of the turgor

424
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:13,230
pressure. And the cell begins to now contract
as we're withdrawing water from it.

425
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:20,230
During this initial contraction, the membrane,
this is the membrane now, is still

426
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:31,210
against 
the wall. But eventually as we withdraw more
water from the cell, that is put it

427
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:42,740
in increasingly more negative solutions on
the outside, we reach the point where the

428
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,029
cell

429
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:47,339
cannot contract anymore. It's now totally
relaxed.

430
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:53,150
However, we're still withdrawing water from
that cell. At that point what we notice

431
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:59,509
is that the membrane is beginning to pull
away from the cell wall. So at some point

432
00:46:59,509 --> 00:46:59,990
the

433
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:06,990
membrane pulls away. And we call that point
which you're going to measure in the lab,

434
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:14,990
we

435
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:21,859
call that point incipient plasmolysis. And
the reason why it's so important to be able

436
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:27,470
to

437
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:34,470
measure incipient plasmolysis is at incipient
plasmolysis, psi sub-p for that particular

438
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:42,109
cell equals zero. So this is why we want to
be able to measure by putting it in

439
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:49,230
increasingly more salty or solute-bound solutions
when the membrane pulls way, because

440
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:54,099
when it pulls away, we know that the psi sub-p
of that cell and you need to know this

441
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:59,849
fact for the problems that we give you, the
psi sub-p of the cell equals 0.

442
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:05,249
Let's now look at a few pictures of plasmolysis.
And I also want to mention to you

443
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:12,249
that I have a couple of YouTube links listed
on the syllabus which show plasmolysis. And

444
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,980
I'd encourage you all to look at those links
before you come to the lab and do the

445
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,730
experiment so you know what you're looking
at.

446
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:25,420
Here is a cell which is now put into solution
with a water potential equal to its

447
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,920
own. The membrane is directly against the
cell wall. And as we begin to withdraw water,

448
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,749
the membrane is pulling away from the cell
wall, which is what you see over here, until

449
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:39,440
we've withdrawn so much water, that is the
water potential outside is so much more

450
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,269
negative that the cell has begun to collapse.

451
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:47,509
So this would be considered perhaps just a
little bit beyond incipient plasmolysis

452
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:49,599
but fairly close to it.

453
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,039
Here is some pictures of cells now that you're
going to have in the lab. The reason

454
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,009
they're purple, we choose cells that are purple
because we need to have some marker that

455
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:02,499
you can see. These cells have an anthocyanin
pigment in them which give them the purple

456
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:03,420
color.

457
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,650
And you're going to do this with onions. Here
with the onion cells that are fully

458
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:11,950
turgid. And as we put them in increasingly
more salty solutions, that is solutions of

459
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:16,660
increasingly more negative water potential,
we cause the membranes to pull away from the

460
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,880
cell wall until we have a completely plasmolyzed
cell.

461
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,559
And finally I just want to point out to you
what I mentioned earlier. Namely, that

462
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:31,480
the wilting of a plant, the loss of the form
is a result of the loss of turgid pressure.

463
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,019
Okay, make sure you spend some time on that
problem set. It will really help you

464
00:49:35,019 --> 00:49:36,059
with these concepts.
