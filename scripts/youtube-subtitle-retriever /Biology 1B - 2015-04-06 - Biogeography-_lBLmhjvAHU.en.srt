1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:04,200
PROFESSOR: How's that? Is that better? Okay,
good. Are we

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,700
good?

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,839
So just about statements and protests. Before
ten past the hour,

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:17,650
that's fine. Our chancellor has a policy about
encouraging free speech. And so

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,960
that will be the policy that we have. But
after ten past, then it's for the

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,960
class. All right, here we are. Second lecture
in the ecology section. Great

7
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,239
to see you here. I know you've got something
else on your mind, like, exam on

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,239
Wednesday evening. I do want to point out
that Professor Shabble has two

9
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:49,379
reviews. Today, 12:00 to 1:30 and also Wednesday,
12:00 to 1:30, room 2195,

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,910
which is one of the labs down the hall. I'll
have office hours. I don't expect

11
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,910
you there this week. Next week perhaps. Those
are in 5045 VLSB.

12
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,390
Last time we talked about, sort of, patterns
of solar radiation.

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,430
We talked about where the winds come from
on earth. We talked about how the

14
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,060
winds strive. The ocean currents. And the
winds and ocean currents and how

15
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,780
they move around the earth, set up a series
of predictions. If organisms are

16
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,600
distributed around the earth because of dispersal,
we predict that they're

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,500
either being blown by the winds or being moved
by the ocean currents and if

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:48,140
that's the case, we expect these organisms
and their ecology and their life

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:55,140
histories and their phylogenies to reflect
those patterns of wind movement and

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,730
ocean currents.

21
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,030
Today we're going to talk about a different
hypothesis. And that

22
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:06,030
is, we know that continents were, at various
times connected and disconnected.

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,739
We have a very good geological history now,
for the movement of the continents

24
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:17,769
and this sets up another set of hypotheses
and another set of predictions. We

25
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,049
know the history of the continents, we know
how they separated and came

26
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,379
together. For those organisms that don't disburse
much and just stay put, we

27
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,290
would expect those organisms and their phylogenies
to match those of the

28
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,599
continents. So that's what we're going to
talk about today.

29
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,599
First, we're going to discuss biomes, these,
sort of, sets of

30
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,370
organisms on earth that resembled each other
in different parts of the earth.

31
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,989
We'll talk about geological history. And then
we'll also talk about how human

32
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,569
activities have influenced the distribution
of organisms.

33
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,450
I just want to back up -- oops, sorry about
that -- just to

34
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:06,219
review one thing from last time. So the sun
hits the earth. It is hottest at

35
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,230
the equator. In fact, the book suggests the
statistic that where the sun is

36
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,969
actually hitting the upper atmosphere, it's
equivalent to 1,400 watt lightbulbs

37
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:20,939
in a cubic meter. So if you think of a cubic
meter and 1,400 watt lightbulbs,

38
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:26,389
those are pretty bright, that's a lot of solar
radiation hitting the earth. And

39
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,180
it is hottest at the equator. At the equator
it heats up the air, shown there

40
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,739
[Indicating] -- I'll try this again. Here
we go.

41
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,200
Heats up the air here [Indicating] Especially
at the equator.

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,239
That hot air can absorb a lot of moisture.
It also rises because it's warm.

43
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,010
And the air gets into the upper atmosphere,
it starts to cool down, and then it

44
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,969
releases that moisture. And that's why the
tropics are so wet of the air has to

45
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,499
go somewhere. Some goes North and some goes
South. It's dry air. And when it

46
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:08,499
comes back to earth, that dry air is coming
roughly, at 30 degrees North and

47
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:15,069
30 degrees South latitude. It is dry air and
so when it comes to earth, those

48
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,760
places on earth tend to be where we have the
deserts at 30 degrees North and

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,060
South.

50
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,410
And it was as I mentioned, because of the
rotation of the earth

51
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:31,410
and what's called the Coriolis Effect, the
winds are moved, either towards the

52
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,660
east or the west depending on whether they're
going North or South and which

53
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,110
latitude -- which hemisphere you're in.

54
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,760
And those winds are also driving the ocean
currents and as I just

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,590
mentioned, the winds and the ocean currents
make predictions if animals disburse

56
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,490
and that way as to how they should be distributed
on earth. All right, that's a

57
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,060
quick review from last time. Any questions
about that? I had a couple of

58
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,040
questions after class.

59
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,860
We talked a little bit about Mediterranean
climates last time.

60
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,780
We, of course, are in a Mediterranean client
here in the Bay Area. We talked

61
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,040
also, about these graphs called climate graphs,
climographs, climate diagrams.

62
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,660
There are different words for them. Shown
here. Here is San Francisco. We get

63
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,410
a lot of rain usually in the winter time.
Not much in the summer. Our

64
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,350
temperature is a little bit hotter in the
summer than it is in the winter time

65
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,640
of the there are other places on earth that
have similar patterns of climate.

66
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,250
Portugal is one of these. Of course, Portugal
is actually in the

67
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,470
Mediterranean region, a climate pattern very
similar to ours, a little bit

68
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,920
hotter in the summer time. Another place -- so
here is France, for example,

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,760
which is pretty no matter Portugal, and like
us, we're just a little below

70
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:01,060
40 degrees North latitude. The mediterranean
region is about the same. And you

71
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,900
can see some similarities here between these
kinds of habitats. They're both

72
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,190
kind of scrubby habitats, chaparral sorts
of habitats.

73
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,910
Even though the plants are different, they've
converged to a

74
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,600
similar kinds of communities and similar kinds
of adaptations. And we'll see

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,770
more of that when we go to the botanical garden
later in the semester. Okay.

76
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:28,490
And southern hemisphere, however, the pattern
is reversed, and

77
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm sure you can figure out why that's the
case. In the southern hemisphere

78
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,320
they get most of their rain in the mediterranean
climates in the middle of the

79
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,880
year, which, of course, is their winter. It's
hotter in January -- December,

80
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,970
January, in the southern latitudes which,
of course, is their summer.

81
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,910
So I'm using this just as an example to point
out that we have

82
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,420
different regions of the earth that share
vegetation characteristics and those

83
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,090
plants and animals in those habitats also
share characteristics. And this is a

84
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,560
great example of mediterranean climates in
the northern hemisphere, but also in

85
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,560
the southern hemisphere and in is South America,
Africa and parts of Australia.

86
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:25,170
Okay. So these general relationships and patterns
and

87
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,800
similarities of habitats across the earth
attracted the attention of early

88
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,520
naturalists. Von Humboldt, in the last two
centuries ago, in the late 1800s,

89
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,000
noticed this. And this is one of his illustrations
from a mountain top in

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,900
Ecuador.

91
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,930
He noticed that as you go up the mountain,
you get different

92
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,180
kinds of vegetation from the bottom to the
top. And very recently, actually,

93
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,270
some researchers from Berkeley retraced his
steps and documented whether these

94
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,950
organisms were moving up and down the mountain.
We'll come back to that later

95
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,450
in the class.

96
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,110
So he had this idea that, with elevation and
also with latitude

97
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,770
your you get different kinds of ecological
communities. And now we recognize

98
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:23,770
this as a major pattern in ecology, and we
call these biomes. Biome is a

99
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,130
characteristic habitat, in terrestrial habitats
they're defined as both

100
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,899
latitude, but also vegetation characteristics.
And we see different biomes as

101
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,969
we go up in elevation. It gets colder, the
temperature and precipitation are

102
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,930
different. And we also see different biomes
as we move from the equator North

103
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,529
and South on earth.

104
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:57,620
We'll be discussing in this, in the ecology
section, quite a bit.

105
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,870
We'll be discussing these two features of
weather and climate, that is

106
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,899
temperature and precipitation. And we'll see
in future lectures, how

107
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,910
temperature and precipitation are very important
for primary productivity which

108
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:18,910
is where all the energy comes from to support
life on earth.

109
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,889
Here is a plot of mean annual precipitation
and mean annual

110
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:26,980
temperature. And it was a best of your knowledge
of different, of these

111
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,980
so-called biomes are plotted here. So we have
on the top right here, we have

112
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:41,529
tropical forests shown in dark green. With
a little bit less, a little colder

113
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:50,060
temperature, temperate deciduous forest shown
there in brown. As it gets less

114
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:56,610
precipitation and a little bit hotter, Savanna
is shown there. And Taiga here,

115
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:03,519
which is a wet carnivorous forest of the northern
latitudes, shown here where

116
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,519
it's a lot cooler. Just about near zero. And
still some precipitation.

117
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,720
So we can classify all these biomes based
on precipitation and

118
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,480
temperature. And I frequently get the question:
Well, do I have to memorize

119
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,120
all those biomes? The answer is no, but if
I were to give you a graph like

120
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,290
this, that's unlabeled and I said: Okay, point
out the desert or point out the

121
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:34,809
tropical rain forests. You should be able
to do that based on temperature and

122
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:38,220
precipitation. Make sense? Okay.

123
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,589
If we look at these terrestrial biomes around
the earth, here we

124
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:46,139
see them. I've just noted on there where the
equator is running through the

125
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,209
middle of the earth, 30 degrees North and
30 degrees South which we've talked

126
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:57,360
about the before. Here is 30 degrees North.
[Indicating] And you can see that

127
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,889
in this area we get some of the desert biomes
here and Savanna, these lighter

128
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:08,329
colors. [Indicating] Towards the equator we
have a band of tropical forest

129
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:11,600
biomes. And then I think it's quite -- oops,
sorry.

130
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,139
I think it's interesting to look at where
we live ourselves in

131
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:21,819
this region. We're just South of a region
of temperate evergreen forest. If

132
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:26,350
you've ever been to Vancouver or Seattle,
Washington, you know that some of

133
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,759
those forests there can be very lush and green.
And certainly The Redwoods

134
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,740
would be that kind of a forest. And you'll
see a great example of those in the

135
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,889
botanical gardens. We also have in this habitat
around us, Chaparral, which is

136
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:46,889
this dry, scrubby biome that's very characteristic.
If you walk into Strawberry

137
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:54,740
Canyon and you look about, or if you're from
the Bay Area, or, actually, most of

138
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,670
California, you'll know what that is.

139
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,670
Okay. The book -- your book mentions eight
major biomes and then

140
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,089
six other ones. I've just put a box here and
I've given you a list at the end

141
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:16,610
of the ones you should probably know something
about. Again, I don't expect you

142
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,749
to know every place on earth where each of
these biomes is found, but if I were

143
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:28,749
to say: What's characteristic of a tropical
rain forest or, you know, how is

144
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:34,269
Taiga different from the Tundra. You should
know those kinds of things.

145
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,439
And in a second I'm going to show you a bunch
of videos that

146
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:43,439
describe these because you're probably not
into each of these. All right, so

147
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:49,300
let me turn this down.

148
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,850
So here is a video that shows tropical rain
forests. And one

149
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:01,059
thing to remember about this is you'll see
just a vast amount of biome mass in

150
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,970
tropical rain forests that's actually in wood.
So the Carbon in tropical rain

151
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,629
forests is stored in the wood, in the trees.
And that's very different from

152
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:15,079
some of these other biomes, like the Savanna,
which I'll talk about in a minute,

153
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,600
where a lot of the biome mass is actually
stored in the bodies of these big

154
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,550
mammalian herbivores examine no the in the
cellulose in the plants.

155
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,649
All right.

156
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:28,939
VIDEO: In this South America rain forest the
day length and

157
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:34,209
temperature change little. Only an annual
cycle of rain and dry marks the

158
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:40,129
seasons. With such stable conditions and relentless
productive, organisms can

159
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:46,889
become specialists in an infinite variety
of narrow niches. (Howling.)

160
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:50,809
The result is an explosive speciation and
a staggering diversity

161
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:56,959
of plants and animals. In six percent of the
earth's surface, are half of the

162
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,959
planet's species. A patch of rain forests
can contain more species of trees

163
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:11,329
than the entire Northeastern United States.

164
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:19,740
[Music]

165
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,199
Biologists estimate there are between five
and 30,000,000 species

166
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,189
of animals in rain forests. They can't count
them more accurately than that.

167
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:32,790
And the number is probably changing as we
watch. If one species appeared on

168
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:39,790
this screen, every second, it would take nearly
a year to see 30,000,000.

169
00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:00,910
[Music]

170
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,670
But the stability of the rain forest is challenged.
This is an

171
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,499
expanding network of roads in the Amazon Valley.
The image was compiled from

172
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:25,149
satellite photographs taken over several years.
In this photograph, taken from

173
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:29,519
the space shuttle, the light colored area
are fields from which the forest has

174
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,519
been completely cleared. What will be the
result of such wholesale disruption

175
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,489
of the rain forest?

176
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:44,889
PROFESSOR: Okay. So that thought we'll come
back to that, and

177
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:49,569
we'll talk about how habitats have changed.
By the way, I'll put all these

178
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:55,679
videos on the bCourses website in a folder
for you as well. Thanks for the

179
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,069
lights.

180
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:00,179
Next we're going to talked about the Savanna
and in contrast to

181
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,499
the rain forest where I have just huge amounts
of Carbon stored in all those

182
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:10,009
trees, and, of course, the trees of the forest
are pulling in Carbon from the

183
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:16,769
atmosphere. In the Savanna, we have a habitat
where the primary productivity is

184
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,189
grass. That's much more ephemeral in nature.

185
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:20,679
[VIDEO]

186
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,189
VIDEO: -- the forest, the constant supply
of water allows

187
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:29,649
primary producers to dominate. On the plains
of east Africa where the seasonal

188
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:35,259
rains make the water supply unreliable, grasses
replace trees as the primary

189
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:40,800
producers. Here there is a shift of biomass
to the large and abundant animal

190
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,800
life. Why can grasses survive here where trees
cannot? Trees invest most of

191
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:53,339
their biomass in woody structures aboveground,
that must be sustained in all

192
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:59,119
weather conditions. Most of the biomass of
these perennial grasses is below

193
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:04,899
ground. And the aboveground shoots are expendable
in dry periods. The shoots

194
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,899
grow when it rains.

195
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:11,309
The expendable shoots are also such an abundant
and accessible

196
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:16,990
food source, that the size and number of grazers
is breathtaking. In the

197
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,250
grasslands of Africa, a large part of the
biomass is in the animals, not the

198
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,110
plants. (Mosquitoes Buzzing).

199
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,510
The volcano soil is rich and full of nutrients.
The grasses make

200
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,210
the nutrients available to the herbivores
who reproduce to the limits of what is

201
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:42,210
available and a bit beyond. The apparent abundance
of food means nothing to a

202
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:49,220
single individual, only that there are more
individuals to compete with, for it.

203
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:53,549
PROFESSOR: Okay, so that's another could have
biome. Again, for

204
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:57,559
these biomes, what I expect you to know is
just the general characteristics of

205
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:04,559
each of those that I've listed at the end
of the lecture. And especially how

206
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:10,539
the different biomes contrast with each other.
And be able to roughly draw them

207
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:15,440
on that figure that shows precipitation and
temperature. We can talk more about

208
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,130
that later in the semester.

209
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:24,220
Okay, aquatic biomes, we're typically less
familiar with. We

210
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:31,220
don't have, you know, identifiable names,
usually, for aquatic biomes.

211
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,299
The aquatic biomes, of course, around the
earth. We know a lot

212
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:42,299
about the ocean zones, enter tidal zones,
coral reefs. And then those are the

213
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:48,640
marine, sort of, aquatic zones. And then we
have fresh water zones as well,

214
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,640
which is a small proportion of all water on
earth. And those are represented in

215
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:03,260
lakes and rivers. And, again, I've asked you
to learn a few of these. Sorry.

216
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,149
They're shown here.

217
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:06,549
[Indicating]

218
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,700
Intertidal zones, estuaries, coral reefs,
rivers and lakes. And

219
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:17,700
within each of these aquatic biomes we have
different kinds of habitats, and

220
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:24,019
these habitats and aquatic systems are defined
by physical characteristics,

221
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:29,309
unlike the terrestrial biomes which were defined
by vegetation characteristics

222
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:35,510
and latitude. So I'm just going to draw a
couple of these over here. These are

223
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:42,510
some figures from your book. Let's see here.

224
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,679
So this is, sort of, a cross-section. And
I'm going to talk

225
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,740
about a lake first. Here is the ground in
the lake. And here is the water

226
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:01,740
surface. So this is a lake. And right here
where the -- here is some -- sorry.

227
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,120
Here is some trees.

228
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,760
And then there's typically some vegetation
by the shore. Can you

229
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,260
see that? If not, you can look on the video
later. Right here, where the water

230
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:28,260
meets the shore, we call that -- sorry this
is hard to see -- the littoral zone.

231
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:45,779
And then this is the lake, the lake bottom.
And there's a part

232
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:52,659
of the lake where the light actually comes
down into the water. We call that

233
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:59,659
the photic zone, and then below that, aphotic.
Photic, meaning light, and

234
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:08,019
aphotic, below. And those are the components
of a lake ecosystem. And the

235
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,110
biomes, if you will, associated with lakes.

236
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:17,100
All right, and it was in marine systems we
have something that's

237
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:24,100
very, very similar. So we have the land. Sometimes
we have a continental shelf

238
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,940
and then it goes way down into the deeper
ocean. Here is our water and the sun

239
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,730
again and some trees.

240
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:43,669
Okay, where the ocean meets the land, of course,
that's the

241
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:50,669
intertidal zone. Then we also note on a layer
of the ocean that's above the

242
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:00,750
continental shelf, we call that the neritic
zone. Actually, I'll write that

243
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,570
down.

244
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,950
Neritic, n-e-r-e-t-i-c. And these words are
all at the end of

245
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:14,950
the lecture for you. And then as we had for
the lakes, we have a photic zone.

246
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,100
And below that aphotic. The surface at the
bottom, we call benthic. And lake

247
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,519
biologists also call the surface benthic.
Let's see.

248
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,279
Benthic. And then just on two more. The open
ocean we think of

249
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:50,279
as pelagic So the open ocean here is pelagic.
And then I won't write it, but

250
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:00,679
there are parts of the ocean that are really,
really deep and we call those the

251
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,049
abyssal zone. I'll show you that in a minute.

252
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:09,720
Okay, so just to summarize, lots of water
on earth. We'll come

253
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,070
back to the meaning of that and productivity
in other lectures. Most of it is

254
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:19,630
marine which means salty, and we can't drink
that. The fresh water is a small

255
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,470
portion of all of water on earth, maybe 20
percent arrow so, in lakes and

256
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:32,470
rivers. And these are distributed around the
earth. So just like the

257
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:40,080
terrestrial biomes, I'm going to show you
a few videos of some of the marine

258
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,070
biomes here.

259
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,360
So on the lower left here is one of these
hydrothermal vents deep

260
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,529
it in the ocean. It's a place where the continental
plates are spreading apart

261
00:23:54,529 --> 00:24:01,529
and there's typically volcanic activity. Hydrogen
Sulfide, which some marine

262
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:07,840
organisms can use and actually oxidize creating
the basis for a whole ecosystem

263
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,840
down there. Here are a few pictures showing
what it's like down there.

264
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:21,539
Some worms here that are attached to the surface.
And then coral

265
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,600
reef habitats.

266
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:22,909
[VIDEO]

267
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,159
SPEAKER: Over the oceans of the world war,
only shallow tropical

268
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,649
waters offer the warm temperatures and reliable
productivity needed to maintain

269
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:37,139
a coral reef ecosystem. The coral polyps and
other invertebrates filter

270
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:42,309
plankton and harbor photosynthetic microorganisms
to bring energy into the

271
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:48,710
reef's food chain. In turn, other invertebrates
and fish graze on the filter

272
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,580
feeders.

273
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,090
Here, the plant and animal diversity is immense.
A reef may

274
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,830
contain as many as 100 species of coral, countless
other invertebrates and

275
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:05,630
several hundred species of fish. This large
nudibranch is a gas tetrapod

276
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:11,309
mollusk that probably grazes on sponges. It
lays thousands of eggs had this

277
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:16,759
fragile rosette.

278
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,970
Nudibranchs come in many shapes, sizes and
colors. They are

279
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,970
often highly specialized feeders. This is
a tunicate, a near relative of the

280
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,389
vertebrates. They are filter feeders. They
pump water in one opening and on

281
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:38,730
you the other extracting food particles and
oxygen. This large yellow sponge is

282
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,950
also a filter feeder.

283
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,929
PROFESSOR: Okay, So these are some rain habitats.
I gave you a

284
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:51,929
link to a really cool video of an Angler Fish
that was taken by a submersible

285
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:58,350
craft by the Monterey bay MBARI. I'm not sure
what that stands for, but it's a

286
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:05,169
research institute that's located on Monterey
Bay and associated with the

287
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:09,600
Hopkins -- with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

288
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Okay, just as we saw for, when we were talking
about climate and

289
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:24,370
weather, we had global patterns of precipitation.
There are also some local

290
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:29,139
phenomena important in aquatic ecosystems.
And one of these has to do with

291
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:32,149
seasonal turn over in temperate lakes.

292
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:38,250
As, you know, when lakes freeze over, because
of the unusual

293
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:43,870
characteristics of water, the lake can actually
be colder. The ice forms at the

294
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:50,470
top which is zero degrees, and that can actually
be colder than the bottom of

295
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,600
the lake which can be three or four degrees
because water happens to be most

296
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,600
dense at three or four degrees centigrade.
So in the winter time in temporal

297
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:10,110
areas, we typically have colder water at the
top and warmer water at the bottom.

298
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,220
In the summer time the reverse is true. The
sun heats up the

299
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,129
tops of the lakes and the top of the lake
is warmer than the bottom. And you

300
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:22,409
know this if you have been swimming in lakes.
Often, you can swim at the top of

301
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:25,769
the lake and you put your feet down or you
dive down a little bit and it gets

302
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,960
quite cold.

303
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,279
So this is an important characteristic of
water. It means that

304
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:38,480
when organisms are in lakes, in the winter
time, they don't necessarily freeze

305
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,799
all wait to the bottom. In fact, life can
persist in the bottom of lakes even

306
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:49,340
when the lakes are frozen over. This idea
of seasonal turn over is an important

307
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,080
one. Again, it just happens this temperate
regions where there's a big

308
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,960
difference it temperature between summer and
winter. So on the idea is that, in

309
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,529
the winter time, this photo on the left, there
could be ice at the top. But you

310
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:07,080
can see the temperature at the top is zero
degrees where the ice is. And it was

311
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,940
actually is warmer as you go down because
the densest -- water is most dense at

312
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,889
four degrees.

313
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:18,779
In the mid summer, we have the opposite. We
have hotter water at

314
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,460
the top. Colder water at the bottom. And then
what happens both in the spring

315
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:30,460
and fall is that the temperature relationship
in the lake turns over completely.

316
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,549
And this is called overturn or turnover. And
the idea is that, at some point in

317
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:43,539
the fall and some point in the spring, the
whole lake gets mixed up as the

318
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,940
temperature resorts itself.

319
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,559
And this gradient in temperature is called
a thermal climb, which

320
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:54,059
you can have in the winter and in the is summer.
And this is one thing that

321
00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:01,059
keeps temperate lakes, especially, productive
in that the nutrients get sloshed

322
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:07,899
around at least twice a year. Also, it means
that if a lake does use up all of

323
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:14,899
its Oxygen in the summer time, when this turnover
happens in the fall and again

324
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:20,330
in the spring it can mix up the water and
provide Oxygen again.

325
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,610
These photos -- actually, I grew up in Maine
and these photos are

326
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:27,870
from very close to where I lived. Okay, next
we're going to move onto

327
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:34,080
continental drifts. So what we've seen so
far today is biomes, both in

328
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,590
terrestrial systems and aquatic systems. In
terrestrial systems, the biomes are

329
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,399
defined by vegetation and latitude. In the
aquatic systems the biomes are

330
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:47,950
defined by the physical characteristics. And
we talked about those, whether

331
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:54,950
it's, you know, light or the kind of habitat
that we saw for both marine and

332
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,049
fresh water systems.

333
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:04,279
All right, so, again, I have a video here
to show you continental

334
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:10,960
drift. But the idea is that, like we had when
we understood the disbursal of

335
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,960
organisms, based on wind currents or water
currents, we can also induce some of

336
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:23,090
the distribution of life on earth if we know
something about the continents,

337
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,590
where those organisms are living. And if the
organisms are not disbursing too

338
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,759
much and if they evolve before the continents
split apart, then we should expect

339
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:37,570
that their current distribution reflects that
of the history of the continents.

340
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,139
[VIDEO]

341
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:43,149
SPEAKER: The continents lie on massive plates
that are in

342
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:48,500
constant motion on earth's surface. Their
movement produces continental drift.

343
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,419
Sometimes forcing continents together and
another times pull them apart. Around

344
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:58,149
500 million years ago, earth's continents
were mostly in the southern hemisphere

345
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:03,240
and continued to move southward. Around this
time, the continents began to

346
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,980
coalesce into larger land masses. The largest,
Gondwana, included the future

347
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:15,590
South America, Africa, India, Australia, and
Antarctica. Around 400 million

348
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,830
years ago the large southern and northern
land masses began to approach each

349
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,730
other. In the Permian period, they collided
and formed a super continent called

350
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,470
Pangea.

351
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,879
The trigger caused volcanic eruptions. Lava
flowed and airborne

352
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:36,769
ash blocked sunlight. Cooling the climate
and triggering glaciation. By

353
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:41,190
150 million years ago, the northern continents
were completely separated from

354
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:46,289
the southern ones. As the continents continued
to move, India and Australia

355
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:51,200
drifted northward to their positions in present
day earth. When India collided

356
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,120
with Asia, the Himalayan mountain range was
formed.

357
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,950
PROFESSOR: Okay. So you're probably asking:
What do I have to

358
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:04,860
remember from that? Really, all I want you
to know is -- geologists know a lot

359
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,220
about the history of the earth and this history
is really well-known. We also

360
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,659
have very precise estimates for when all this
happened. And so we can use these

361
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:20,529
estimates to help us understand the diversity
of life on earth, but I don't

362
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:25,799
expect you to know really all of that, that
we just saw. Except maybe that

363
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,490
there are some southern continents that were
once together and are now apart.

364
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,970
One thing I thought was pretty cool and maybe
you didn't miss it

365
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,220
or maybe you missed it, but we'll come back
to it is that New Zealand and

366
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,539
Australia were actually two of the first parts
of this big southern continent to

367
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:46,470
break apart even though they're quite similar.
And we in the northern

368
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,970
hemisphere kind of think of them as all the
same place. But actually New

369
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:56,749
Zealand and Australia were some of the first
land masses to split from this

370
00:32:56,749 --> 00:33:00,809
southern continent. That will become important
in just a second.

371
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:05,590
Okay, as I said, geologists have a really
good feeling for this.

372
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:10,580
It's remarkable that all of what we know about
continental drift is really only

373
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:17,169
50, 60, 70 years old, but it has really revolutionized
what we think about life

374
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:21,769
on earth. And here, just some of the plates.
You know, a lot about the Pacific

375
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:26,240
plate and the North American plate because
they're sliding by each other. Here

376
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,590
in California which creates our earthquakes.

377
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,690
Some of these plates, you'll notice, are splitting
apart creating

378
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,990
these big ridges in the middle of the ocean.
Some are coming together. For

379
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,840
example, the Indian plate smashing into the
Eurasian plate creating the

380
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Himalayan mountains and so on. So we have
those actions that are splitting

381
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:55,200
continents apart and we also have actions
that are pushing these continents

382
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,309
together.

383
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:00,259
As a result of this movement of the plates,
those organisms that

384
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:06,240
evolved in those places are being split apart
from each other and in some cases,

385
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,240
they're coming back together. So let me just
show you.

386
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,309
So let's just look at a few of these. So this
figure is kind of

387
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:31,970
cool in that it shows the years since these
different parts of the earth were

388
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:37,950
joined together. So, for example -- just a
second here.

389
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,679
South America and Africa were last joined
about 100 million years

390
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,089
ago. The tip of Antarctica I can from Australia,
also 100 million years ago.

391
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:55,089
New Zealand and Antarctic, 80 million, but
parts of Australia and South America

392
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,730
to Antarctica, you know, only 40 or 50 million
years ago. You don't have to

393
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:05,130
remember those numbers. I just want you to
get the idea that geologists know a

394
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,710
lot about this. And it makes this set of predictions
that we're going to use in

395
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,280
a minute.

396
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,520
There are also places where the plates are
coming together. For

397
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,440
example, South America and North America smashed
together about 6 million years

398
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,780
ago and a lot of organisms went back and forth,
as you know already. When that

399
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:29,530
happens, we call that biotic exchange, where
organisms from different continents

400
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:36,530
meet, and exchange with each other because
they can. The same thing happened

401
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:43,829
here when the oriental plate hit the Palearctic
plate here, and then also with

402
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,160
Africa running into Europe.

403
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,270
All right, so the point there is that the
history these

404
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:58,440
continents makes for very clear predictions.
There are some places here, for

405
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,440
example, Wallace's Line here [Indicating]
There still are deep divisions between

406
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:11,900
parts of the earth that have been separated
for a very long time. And these can

407
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,970
be both marine and terrestrial systems. And
we'll come back to that in a

408
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,290
minute.

409
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,210
Well Wallace, as would you have heard about
in the evolution

410
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,800
section, thought a lot about life on earth,
and he divided the world up into

411
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,000
these biogeographic regions based on the kinds
of organisms that were there.

412
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,079
And this largely reflects the history of these
continents. And more recently --

413
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,690
and again this is just an example, but I don't
expect you to memorize it -- more

414
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:47,390
recently researchers have used phylogenetic
methods to look at the similarity of

415
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,079
organisms from these different places on earth.

416
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:57,079
And in this graph, the similar colors suggest
that or are used to

417
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,790
indicate similarity of different kinds of
organisms in these different places,

418
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,300
and colors that are very different from each
other are used to indicate

419
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,030
organisms that are very different phylogenetically
from each other.

420
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,400
And what you can see is that the Austral Australian
region there

421
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,720
has organisms that are very different from
the rest of the earth as are

422
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Madagascar shown there in brown. North and
South America, they are different,

423
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,750
but there are some similarities. And then
a lot of similarities across Europe

424
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,869
and Asia and actually into Africa.

425
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:37,869
And these researchers also looked at more
detail at different

426
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,819
taxonomic groups and pretty much the same
pattern is shown in each of these

427
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:48,069
taxonomic groups. Australia is really different.
Amphibians at the top, of

428
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:52,809
course, they don't move over water very well.
And so you can see that places

429
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:57,010
like Madagascar, New Guinea there above Australia
and so on, are really

430
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,990
different. Birds here shown in the middle,
you can see that because birds fly

431
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,609
and they can move. They move between North
and South America. So there's some

432
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:13,609
similarity there. Oops, sorry about that.

433
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,069
Mammals also have moved across North and South
America, as you

434
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:26,180
know from understanding the history of things
like marsupials and raccoons and

435
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:32,369
things like that. Anyway, so this old idea
of Wallace's, that we have

436
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:39,369
biogeographic regions or zoographic regions,
we now know is largely based on the

437
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:43,980
continents moving around and the history of
these organisms tied to those

438
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,400
continents. And that's a process called vicariance
where the distribution of

439
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,790
organisms is the result of where they evolved.

440
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,359
Separations in these organisms in terms of
speciation or

441
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,260
diversification are due to geological processes.
And that's a very different

442
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,050
explanation for the distribution of life on
earth than dispersal, which is one

443
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,349
that says things are the way they are because
they've moved there regardless of

444
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,900
what the history of the continents were.

445
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,250
I want to come back for just some examples
of some of these

446
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:23,900
biogeographic barriers, and I want to point
out that these barriers concur both

447
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:30,180
in the marine systems as well as terrestrial
systems. There's an area between

448
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:36,809
Southeast Asia and Australia that has a very
dynamic geological history. And

449
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:42,400
over time, since the Pleistocene, with the
sea level going up and down, at

450
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,160
various times this area was connected and
became disconnected, which resulted

451
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,500
actually, and probably a lot of species being
formed as these land masses became

452
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,819
disconnected.

453
00:39:55,819 --> 00:40:00,109
But there is a line in there where there is
deep water that was

454
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:05,569
never connected. And this is Wallace's Line,
which Wallace noted. And that

455
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:11,349
flows through here. There are also some other
deep trenches in the oceans. And

456
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:16,079
I want to just remind you, again, this abyssal
zone and we're going to take a

457
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,940
look at one of these deep ocean areas in this
video.

458
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:29,940
Okay, so this is James Cameron who is a noted
film maker. And

459
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,250
when you have just so much money and so much
time on your hands, what do you do?

460
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:40,630
You build a cool sub examining to the deepest
parts of the ocean. So let's see

461
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,500
this here.

462
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:41,940
[VIDEO]

463
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,960
NARRATOR: Pilot coming out. National Geographic
explore and

464
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,710
residence, James Cameron, has finished a record
dive to the deepest part of the

465
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:50,960
earth's ocean.

466
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,160
(Applause.)

467
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:57,940
MR. CAMRON: The Challenger Deep, which is
only a small part of

468
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:03,589
the Mariana Trench is something like 50 times
the size of the grand canyon of

469
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:10,329
the so, you know, this is a vast, you know,
frontier down there. It's going to

470
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:12,030
take us a while to understand.

471
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,180
NARRATOR: The dive follows seven years of
planning and the

472
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,510
design and construction of a specialized straight
of the art submersible for the

473
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,500
deepest solo man dive in history.

474
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,079
MR. CAMRON: The whole sub actually squeezes
down almost three

475
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,750
inches in length when it gets to the bottom
of the ocean just because of the

476
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:37,829
pressure. The sphere I'm in, actually shrinks
much the window that I look out

477
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:44,059
actually pushes in toward me under 16,000
pounds per square inch of pressure.

478
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:47,390
NARRATOR: Cameron spent more than three hours
in the lowest

479
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:52,869
point of the Mariana Trench about seven miles
down, filming and documenting what

480
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:54,700
he saw and taking samples.

481
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:01,130
MR. CAMRON: It was very lunar, very desolate
place, very

482
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:05,490
isolated. My feeling was one of complete isolation
from all of humanity. I

483
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:10,059
mean, I felt like I literally, in the space
of one day, had gone to another

484
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:11,710
planet and come back.

485
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:16,059
NARRATOR: Armed with an eat foot panel of
led lights and

486
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:21,349
cameras, Cameron will be able to share with
the rest of the world, a part of the

487
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:23,359
planet that is virtually unknown.

488
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,760
SPEAKER: Many of the animals that live there
have adapted to

489
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,319
this extreme pressure, this total darkness.
They're usually white. They have

490
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,740
no pigments. Some of them have eyes to see
bioluminescence. Some of them have

491
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,910
no eyes at all. It's completely alien world.
[Laughter]

492
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:46,410
NARRATOR: Cameron is the first person to reach
the deepest point

493
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:52,930
of the Mariana Trench in more than 50 years.
[Music]

494
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:59,660
PROFESSOR: Okay, there you go. In the time
that I have left I

495
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,280
have two things: First, I want to give you
an example of how we use that

496
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,240
information about vicariance to test predictions
about how organisms are where

497
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,849
they are. And this is sort of analogous to
what I did at the end of the last

498
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:17,030
lecture with the work of what Rosemary Gillespie
and I were doing looking at how

499
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:24,030
we can use predictions about dispersal, wind
and ocean currents to understand

500
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,319
why organisms are where they are.

501
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,650
So now, I want to give you two examples of
how researchers using

502
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:37,650
use information about continental drift to
test the same kinds of hypotheses,

503
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,430
but in this case, not dispersal, but vicariance
which I talked about.

504
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:48,040
And this is a textbook example of vicariance
and it refers to

505
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,549
this genius of plants, Nothofagus, called
the southern beech. And later in the

506
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:58,599
semester you'll go to the botanical garden
and you'll see these from both South

507
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:05,549
America and Australia and New Zealand shown
here.

508
00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:12,549
So as we saw in the video, at one point this
Gondwana continent

509
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:20,030
was all connected and then it split apart.
And we can use those dates to test

510
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:29,069
whether the distribution of this beech lineage
is a result of that splitting

511
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,380
apart of the continents or whether we need
too explain their distribution with

512
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:40,380
some more recent dispersal. All right, and
the way this works is this.

513
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,660
We can make a cladogram that is a phylogeny
of the land masses,

514
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:51,390
and we call this an area cladogram. And that's
shown here. What this cladogram

515
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:58,390
shows is just really a tree, but it summarizes
when these different land masses,

516
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,750
New Zealand, New Caledonia, South America,
West Antarctica, New Guinea last

517
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:11,750
shared a connection. All right, so Australia,
New Guinea separated only ten to

518
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,530
15 million years ago.

519
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:19,140
Australia and this part of Gondwana separated
from New Zealand

520
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:25,630
and New Caledonia a long time ago, like, 80
to 90 million years ago. So that's

521
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:31,339
what this diagram shows. So then what we do
for any taxon, if we're interested

522
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:36,780
in weather, this explains the distribution.
We take that taxon, we make a

523
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,099
molecular phylogeny of the taxon itself and
we ask: Well, for any groups of

524
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:48,329
organisms in that phylogeny, how long ago
did they share on a common ancestor?

525
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:53,109
And then we can compare the real phylogeny
to that we know of the geology and

526
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:58,049
ask: Do they match or not? That is, is the
real phylogeny old enough to be

527
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:05,049
explained by this phylogeny of the land masses,
or do we need dispersal to

528
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,160
explain the new phylogeny?

529
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:14,160
All right, so people have done that. Sorry.

530
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:20,140
Here are the results. And this is just what
I just said in a

531
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:26,270
nutshell. That is, we get a molecular phylogeny
here on the right and we look

532
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:31,920
at different taxon in that lineage and we
say: When did they share a common

533
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,099
ancestor? And we can ask: Does that match
the phylogeny of the plates, the

534
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:39,119
geology?

535
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,410
So these gray bars here, the one on the left
there shows when

536
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:48,290
Australia and New Zealand were last connected,
that's 80 million years ago or

537
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:52,609
so. And the gray bar in the middle shows when
Antarctica, South America and

538
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:57,359
Australia were last connected, and that's,
like, 40 million years ago. And

539
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,890
shown in the top there are on a whole bunch
of these comparisons. Between at

540
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:06,930
the top there is South America and Australia,
and South America and Australia

541
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:11,799
for another taxon. And they use different
genes and look to see how different

542
00:47:11,799 --> 00:47:15,200
these plants were, and they can put a date
on that based on this idea of

543
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,280
molecular clocks, with you know. And they
found at least for that set of taxon,

544
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,380
at the top, the observed dates from the biology
match the predictions from the

545
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,900
plate tectonics or continents moving very,
very well.

546
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,220
What we would say there is that: Yes, indeed
those plants are

547
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,539
where they are on earth because they've been
stuck on these continents that are

548
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:40,829
separated since that time.

549
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:44,650
However, there's another comparison here between
plants found in

550
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:50,869
New Zealand and Australia shown here on the
lower right. And what we see with

551
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:57,030
these observed dates for this group, is that,
in fact, these observed dates are

552
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:04,030
much too young to be explained by vicariance
in the continents moving. So the

553
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:08,390
dates between plants in Australia and New
Zealand are only, say, 20 million

554
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:14,200
years ago. We know that Australia and New
Zealand actually split up 80 million

555
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:20,730
years ago. So they must have disbursed from
one place to another much more

556
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,470
recently.

557
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:24,289
And this is not so unreasonable because we
know that Australia

558
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:27,309
and New Zealand are actually quite close to
each other. So maybe there's a

559
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:34,309
chance through either ocean currents or winds,
for these plants to move from one

560
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:40,020
of these places to the other. Okay, so that's
an example of how we can use

561
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:45,970
knowledge about the history of the continents
to say something about the history

562
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:49,430
of these organisms and the importance of disbursal.

563
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:53,930
And then just one slide before we go. Here
is another example.

564
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:57,359
And this was actually done by a student of
Rosemary Gillespie. This is an

565
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:03,480
Assassin Spider. This is really a spider.
Here is its jaws. So this is

566
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,970
actually its head and its eyes. This is its
body here, and these jaws are

567
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,819
really long, because it feeds on other spiders
and it wants to keep them at an

568
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:16,839
arm's length or at jaw's length so that the
other spider doesn't come and try to

569
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:18,000
kill this spider.

570
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,059
These spiders are also distributed around
the southern

571
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:28,119
continents, and I just want to leave you with
this point that, just like for the

572
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:34,920
last example -- and you don't need to read
this or understand this other than

573
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,410
the distribution of these organisms also,
is predicted by continental drift. So

574
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:44,970
sure, big trees and things like that that
might not disburse much. We might

575
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:49,750
expect them to follow these patterns, but
we also see that for animals that are

576
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,380
not highly dispersive.

577
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:58,500
Okay, that's it. We'll follow up with the
rest of this topic.

578
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Again, there's a review session today from
12:00 to 1:30 and also Wednesday, and

579
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,410
your exam for the evolution section on Wednesday
evening.
