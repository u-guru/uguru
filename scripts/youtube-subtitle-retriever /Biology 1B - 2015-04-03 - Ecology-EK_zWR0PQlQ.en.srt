1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,510
PROFESSOR: Okay, can you hear me back there?
Is the microphone

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,480
working?

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,269
Welcome, my name is George Roderick and I'm
in Environmental

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:19,220
Science Policy and Management. I'll be with
you for the next -- for the rest of

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,450
the semester, the last third.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,750
This is the ecology section and I have to
say I admire you for

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,320
first of all, showing up at 8:00 and secondly
showing up when you have a midterm

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,320
coming up next week for the evolution section.
So the first couple of lectures,

9
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,899
I hope, are largely review. We're going to
cover what I would call physical

10
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,819
geography, which is, sort of, the environment
that organisms find themselves in.

11
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:54,719
We're going to look at why we see similarities
of organisms around the earth.

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,100
Today, we're going to talk about dispersal,
why organisms look

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,979
like other organisms in different places because
they disburse there. Next time

14
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,600
we'll talk about vicariance, which I'll explain
later which is organisms that

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,600
are there, where they are, because of the
land underneath them.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:30,750
So let me just spend a few minutes on logistics.
My department,

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,060
ESPM, office hours: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
at 9:00 to 10:00. So right

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,410
after this class on Monday and Wednesday,
and then Tuesday also. And then just

19
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,520
so that, if those times don't work for you,
I picked another time that I thought

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,010
would be quite different, Thursday from 2:00
to 3:00. And if all those times

21
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,480
don't work for you, I'm happy to meet at some
other point too, but let's see how

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,810
those go.

23
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,450
I have a separate email that's just for this
class, and I get a

24
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,290
lot of emails because of what I do for our
department. So if you send it to

25
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,750
this email it goes to one mailbox and I'll
do my best to respond to those within

26
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,489
the day.

27
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:17,060
The topics I've organized in this way: The
environment, the

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,310
first two lectures. Then we'll talk about
populations and we'll talk about

29
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,560
ecological communities. And then finally ecosystems
and global biology. And

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,099
this largely fits the outline of the book.
However, the book has one section at

31
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,959
the end which is all about how we apply this
stuff and how it relates to the

32
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,680
world. And I prefer to put some of that into
each lecture. And so I'll draw a

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,840
little bit from the last part of the book
as we go. As you'll see, I've

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,859
organized my lectures -- they're all the same
way, maybe a little bit boring in

35
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:57,389
the organization, but I think it will help
you. There's an outline, you'll see

36
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:03,829
this in a minute, with rewarding from our
textbook and that's also a syllabus

37
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:07,139
with a list of reading that's on the website.

38
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,989
Each day, I'm going to give you a video that
I would like you to

39
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,139
look at before you come to class. And I'm
hoping -- just five minutes or three

40
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:19,159
minutes -- and I'm hoping that we can use
that to have some discussion. I sort

41
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,069
of feel that if you take the effort to come
here at 8:00 o'clock, at least we'll

42
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:29,620
make it enjoyable for you. And also, I feel
that you're going to learn the most

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,749
if you show up here and listen compared to
watching at home, which, of course,

44
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:35,519
is fine as well.

45
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,809
In the lectures, we'll try to cover general
concepts. We'll look

46
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:44,549
at case studies. They're sort of classic studies
in ecology that you should

47
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:50,349
know about. We'll also look at examples that
deal with health. Many of you are

48
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:57,349
prehealth or planning to go onto health professions
and ecology relates to

49
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:03,419
health in many, many ways. Especially, with
respect to disease and the human

50
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,189
condition. And then finally, examples for
California, because that is where we

51
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,699
are, and it's fun to think about that.

52
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:14,659
For each lecture, I have a section called
Bear Profs where I'll

53
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:19,699
give you a list of professors at Berkeley
who are doing this kind of work for

54
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,690
their own research. And it's a way for you
to figure out who you might contact

55
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,400
if you want to work in their laboratories.
And then finally a list of terms and

56
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,670
concepts which I won't go over in the lecture,
but they're there at the end of

57
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,200
each lecture. You know that if you've looked
already. And then questions, feel

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,930
free to ask them at any time. I'm supposed
to repeat they might. I might ask

59
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,240
you your name. I'd like to learn some of your
names, but feel free to ask.

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,920
I'll ask you questions. I'll ask you some
questions today, but you can ask me

61
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,360
questions anytime.

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,150
Okay, I know that many of you took AP BIO
in high school and so

63
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,400
we'll try not to repeat that. We're going
to focus more on the concepts and

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,760
less on just memorizing because I know there's
a lot of memorizing. And then,

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,540
just to point out, I think that office hours
are alarmingly unappreciated. Very

66
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,870
few people actually come to office hours.
Come by and we can talk about this.

67
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,140
We can talk about your roommate, we can talk
about careers in science, really,

68
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,380
whatever you like.

69
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,980
Okay, the midterm for this section -- I know
you don't want to

70
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,700
think about another midterm, but for this
section the midterm and the final are

71
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:37,310
both on the same day, which is May 11th. So
the first hour will be the midterm

72
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,610
for the ecology part and then the last two
hours, the final exam. What you need

73
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,090
to know for this section, anyway, is everything.

74
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,080
We're going to focus mostly on the lectures,
but I do expect you

75
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,500
to read the book. It's not difficult. It's
about nine pages total for every

76
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,000
lecture and when you take out the questions
at the end, maybe four or five pages

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,810
for every lecture. And I view the book as
background, not that you have to

78
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,580
memorize it, but especially if you don't get
what I'm trying to tell you here,

79
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,720
you can look in the book and see that. Also
the lab materials. Especially the

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,110
write ups -- I mean, the documents that we
give you before the lab that

81
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,860
introduce it. There's some material in there
as well. Especially, in the later

82
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,590
labs. And then, like the another professors
I'll post some sample questions and

83
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,090
we'll have review session. Okay, that's a
lot of bookkeeping.

84
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,640
So here we go. Each lecture, I'll start off
with a slide like

85
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,640
this. It's in bCourses for you. The pages
that you're supposed to read. Video

86
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,680
that I would like to you look at and, if we
have time at the end, I can play

87
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,140
that video. This one has to do with Governor
Brown and his statement just

88
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,300
recently, saying that we're going to mandate
a 25% cut in water use in

89
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,240
California. And this is really interesting
and it's very relevant to biology

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,250
and to health and everything that we do. What's
interesting is that that

91
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,640
doesn't include agriculture, which we can
talk about.

92
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,250
Here is one of the slides or the graphics
that go along with that

93
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,240
video that show the snow pack. And here you
can see the snow pack in the last

94
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,890
four or five years is really, really low,
a record low compared to all the time

95
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,810
that they have been keeping record since the
1950s.

96
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,160
I start each lecture just reviewing where
we were last time. You

97
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,180
just finished the evolution section with Professor
Shabble. You've got an exam

98
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,430
coming up. Today, we're going to talk about
ecology, the importance of the

99
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,660
environment, a little bit about topography
and the distribution of organisms,

100
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,680
and we're going to focus, today, on dispersal.
And we're going to contrast that

101
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,470
with what you learn about next time, having
to do with vicariance.

102
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,270
That leads us into biogeography next time.
Any questions about

103
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:08,270
the format or what's expected? We're good?
All right.

104
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,300
So here we go. The other thing I like to do
is walk around, sort

105
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,560
of, Phil Donahue style, so I'm going to do
that. And who knows what this animal

106
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,550
is? Actually you probably know if you've looked
at the notes. Does anyone

107
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:21,920
know?

108
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,010
STUDENT: A badger.

109
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,180
PROFESSOR: A badger. Who said that?

110
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,910
STUDENT: [Inaudible]

111
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,360
PROFESSOR: What's your name?

112
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,090
STUDENT: [Inaudible]

113
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,660
PROFESSOR: [Inaudible] So do you know where
this was taken or

114
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,700
can you guess where badgers are from?

115
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,110
STUDENT: [Inaudible]

116
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,300
PROFESSOR: Where? Sierra Nevada. Yeah. Well
this is actually

117
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:45,020
from Washington State, but I'm using these
sets of organisms to give you a

118
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,690
feeling for how animals and plants and organisms
are adapted to their

119
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,890
environment. And you've learned a lot about
adaptation already through

120
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,440
adaptation through the process of natural
selection. And we'll talk about other

121
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,440
kinds of ways that organisms can live in the
environment as well.

122
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,550
So these are already -- come pre labeled,
so I guess I won't ask

123
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:17,000
you what those are. That's a bedbug. Has anyone
ever seen a bedbug? They're

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,190
actually not that big. They're kind of, you
know, a couple of millimeters big.

125
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,180
But they make they're living, of course, living
on you, and they're becoming a

126
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,210
serious problem here in the Bay Area. Largely
in hotels, but also in your

127
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,270
houses. They're quite difficult to get rid
of. They come out at night and feed

128
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,200
on you and it was during the day, they go
in and hide under your mattress and in

129
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,910
your curtains. But they're highly adapted,
as you can see, to being flat. You

130
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,010
went feel them if they're crawling on you.
And they're also well camouflaged.

131
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,779
The badger, it has some characteristics too,
for its environment.

132
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,160
And you can see that it's got claws. It's
digging. It's got fur that

133
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,960
camouflages it to its habitat. On the lower
right there is a California Tiger

134
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,440
Salamander. Has anyone seen one of those in
California? Yeah? Where did you

135
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,200
see it?

136
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
STUDENT: My Muir Woods.

137
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,170
PROFESSOR: Okay. He saw it in the woods. Not
in the desert

138
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:25,620
though, right? So it's in a place where it
has to have a moist or water area

139
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,000
for its raising its young. Again, a very different
kind of environment than the

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,680
badger shown there. And then finally, mold
on oranges -- I'm sure you've seen

141
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,770
mold -- hopefully, not too much, but mold,
of course, is very highly specific to

142
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,380
what it's growing on. In this case an orange.
But some molds are very

143
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,500
important, like, penicillin and so on. And
I just wanted to show you these to

144
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,430
make you think about how these organisms are
adapted to where they live.

145
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,500
One of the ways that you've heard about already
is natural

146
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,750
selection. Sorry, let me turn this on here.
One of the ways that organisms

147
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:13,750
become well suited to their habitats is through
natural selection.

148
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,270
And I hope you know a lot about that already.
But there's also a

149
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:25,339
way that organisms can live in environments
and change with their environments,

150
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:32,339
and that's called homeostasis, which is the
idea that organisms can maintain a

151
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,540
balance between that and the conditions that
they're living in, by changing

152
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,610
themselves within a generation. So it's not
natural selection. It's not

153
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:50,610
genetic, but it's just a way of being adaptable
in the plasticity kind of sense.

154
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,440
And this homeostasis can be morphological...for
example, if that

155
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:06,010
badger gets longer fur in the colder seasons,
that's a change that you will see

156
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,180
in its morphology, but it's not necessarily
a genetic change. It can be

157
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,970
physiological. Just a second here.

158
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:22,970
For example, if there's less food or more
food, the animals or

159
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:30,839
plants can respond accordingly and also, at
least for animal's behavioral.

160
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:42,899
Okay.

161
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,070
When we think about ecology, we think about,
sort of, levels of

162
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:56,070
organization. So ecology itself...ecology
is the study of organisms, of course,

163
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,870
and they're environments. And this was a term
that was coined by Earnest

164
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:09,870
Haeckel. Let me just check the spelling 

165
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,529
on that. H-a-e-c-k-e-l. 1866.

166
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,920
You don't have to remember the date, but the
name is important.

167
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Ecology is from a Greek word: oikos, which
means house or home. And ology is

168
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:45,010
the study of. Sorry about that.

169
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:51,149
Okay. And we think of ecology -- let me get
through these things

170
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:58,149
here. When we think of the study of ecology,
we think of levels of organization

171
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:08,350
or hierarchical ways to think about life.
So there's a operator dog there which

172
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:14,330
we might think of as badger food. And we can
study the ecology of that organism

173
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:20,410
as an individual, how it responds to the environment,
how it itself gives birth,

174
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,750
lives and dies.

175
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,890
And then if we have groups of individuals,
or groups of

176
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,420
organisms, we call that a population. So a
population is a group of organisms

177
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,040
of the same species. Typically interbreeding,
but not necessarily so. And it

178
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,760
was if we have groups of populations that
are interacting that is just the

179
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,880
biology part, predator-prey, competitors of
different species interacting. That

180
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,880
is a community. And then when we add the environmental
component, that's the

181
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:02,310
ecosystem. So if we have a set of organisms
interacting in a community and we

182
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,250
put them in an environmental setting we call
that the ecosystem.

183
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,779
And the next level up is the biosphere, that
is the whole earth

184
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,860
and all the biology that's found there. And
some people also distinguish a

185
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,850
landscape scale between the ecosystem and
the biosphere. So you might have sets

186
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,810
of ecosystems, for example, in Yosemite, ranging
from grasslands to the

187
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,050
mountains and you put those together and you
might think of that as a landscape.

188
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,730
There are other kinds of ecosystems too or
other kinds of

189
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:45,730
systems. Let me just write down the word system.

190
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,060
And we can also look within any of these organisms
and we'd find

191
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:56,810
a whole other set of populations, set of communities.
In fact, even an

192
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,450
ecosystem. As, you know, our own stomachs
are filled with microorganisms that

193
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,540
are very diverse, and we'll talk about some
of the biology of those organisms

194
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,450
and disease later.

195
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,750
And then we can also think of systems that
include, you know,

196
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,050
people, and how people interact with the natural
ecosystems. We might think of

197
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:25,870
the Cal campus as a community. It's certainty
a set of interacting organisms.

198
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:32,010
You know, there's environment involved. There's
foraging and so on. So we can

199
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:38,300
think of ecology as a hierarchy of these different
systems, and how organisms

200
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,800
are interacting with their environment.

201
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,800
A good -- much of what we think of, in terms
of our environment,

202
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,290
has to do with the weather, what it's like
outside. So the weather is really

203
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:00,029
just the conditions of temperature and precipitation
that are happening today.

204
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,559
Our weather in San Francisco area is very
characteristic. We have a lot of fog.

205
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,240
We also have some sunny days. And if we look
at the patterns of weather over a

206
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,240
year, we can see trends that go up and down
and we call those, of course, the

207
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:24,370
seasons. And we can portray patterns of temperature
and precipitation over the

208
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:31,020
year in a graph, sometimes called a climograph
or a climate diagram, a climate

209
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,640
graph. And here is one for San Francisco.
And these typically show temperature

210
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,710
on one side and precipitation on the other.

211
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,900
And the scale really isn't important, but
what is important is

212
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,230
how temperature and precipitation vary over
time and how they don't vary in the

213
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,370
same way, over time.

214
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,340
So this is very characteristic of a Mediterranean
climate, which

215
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,170
we'll talk about next time. So in San Francisco,
as, you know, we have periods

216
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,230
of rain usually in the winter time. And then
almost no rain in the summer. All

217
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,290
this, we have some fog. And our temperature
shown here in red actually varies

218
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,929
very little across the year. And it's important
that you understand these

219
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:16,000
diagrams. I'll show you a few more. Another
reason to know about those

220
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,900
diagrams is that if you're traveling and you
look in the lonely planet guide,

221
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,380
you'll see these kinds of diagrams. And it's
quite useful to know when, in the

222
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,600
year, you're going to have rain and when it
will be sunny. Question.

223
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,140
STUDENT: Would you clarify the difference
between climate and

224
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,650
weather?

225
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,440
PROFESSOR: Okay. So her question was: What's
the difference

226
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,120
between a climate and weather? So weather
is what's happening at any point in

227
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,520
time. It's the atmospheric conditions at any
point in time. And climate is the

228
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,309
average of those over some period.

229
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:54,559
Okay, well, let me show you one for New York.
Here on the right

230
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,670
is a climate diagram for New York. What's
interesting is that in any given

231
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,750
month they get about the same as we do in
any month and in the winter time. But

232
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,610
they're also getting, in New York, rain throughout
the year. Those are the blue

233
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,640
bars. And they're temperature, unlike ours,
is quite -- it varies a lot through

234
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,640
this -- through the year. So in New York -- sorry,
I have to use this gizmos

235
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:27,970
thing to point so you can see it at home.
I didn't mean to do that.

236
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,590
You can see this red line here going up and
down. That's the

237
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,900
temperature, and it's changing a lot. It's
hot in New York in the summer time

238
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:43,040
and cold in the winter time. Okay.

239
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,799
And then let me show you one more. Here is
Mangalore, India

240
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:52,240
which is a tropical region. And this is really
interesting because they're

241
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,530
rainfall, like ours, is clustered just in
one time of the year. They get the

242
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:03,660
rainfall in their summer time. But what's
also interesting is that their

243
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,340
temperature is hot. So here, this graph is
reverse the axis, but the

244
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:16,679
temperature here between 25� and 30� all
year around, and the rainfall, some

245
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:23,090
serious rain, of course, in their summer time.
The book calls this a monsoon

246
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,950
pattern. We call this a Mediterranean climate
where we are. And this monsoon

247
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,320
is created because these continental regions
can get so hot, and base of the

248
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,520
uplift, they can pull the low pressure -- they
can pull moisture from the oceans

249
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,230
and create just huge atoms of rain at certain
times of the year.

250
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,190
We also get monsoon patterns in the Southwest
U.S. in southern

251
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:57,190
Arizona. For example, when it gets very hot
in the central U.S. That can pull

252
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:03,059
moisture from the Gulf of California up into
the Southwest. Okay.

253
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:08,650
So the point here: Climate, seasonality, weather.
You should

254
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,929
understand that depending on these different
patterns of precipitation through

255
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,130
the year, and temperatures through the year,
we're going to get very different

256
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,540
kinds of organisms. And we'll talk about that
next lecture as well.

257
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,960
All right, well, next I'm going to talk about
patterns of wind

258
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,850
and ocean currents. And as we will see later
in the semester too, all of this

259
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:42,610
is driven by the sun. So the sun here -- I
didn't mean to do that one yet.

260
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,960
Sorry.

261
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,630
Here we go. So the sun is what's important
in driving the winds.

262
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,610
And the winds drive the ocean patterns. We'll
see, later in the semester, the

263
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,850
importance of sun for primary productively
as well.

264
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,290
Okay, so we know that the sun hits the earth
and at the equator

265
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:10,290
this is most intense. And as the earth tilts
on its axis during the year, the

266
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,410
sunlight hits the earth in a slightly different
way. What's interesting here is

267
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:23,370
that the sunlight hits the earth more towards
the pole at a different angle of

268
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:30,370
incidence, it's called, has a number of effects.
One is that towards the pole,

269
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:36,440
the sunlight is actually going through more
of the atmosphere. So let's try

270
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,320
this here.

271
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,410
So here, down here when the sunlight is going
through the

272
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,510
atmosphere here and hitting the earth, it's
actually going through more

273
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,250
atmosphere because the earth is tilted. And
so the sunlight is going at an

274
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,410
angle through more of the atmosphere. You
know this. When the sun is setting,

275
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:59,140
for example, it's a lot less intense than
when it is at the top.

276
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,549
And it's also the case that down here [Indicating]
closer to the

277
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:10,549
poles, the sunlight is spread over a larger
surface area because the earth is

278
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,760
sloped away from the sun down here at the
bottom. [Indicating]

279
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,340
Anyway, as a result of these two things, the
sunlight hits the

280
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:25,340
earth is more intense at the equator than
at the poles, all right.

281
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,419
And when the earth rotates around the sun,
and you know that

282
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:39,700
already from previous studies, that the earth
is tilted. As a result of this,

283
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,610
parts of the earth receive more sun at different
times of the year than other

284
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:49,710
parts of the earth. And what this means is
that you get a lot of variation in

285
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,049
temperature, anyway, as you get farther from
the poles -- or farther from the

286
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:56,410
equators.

287
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,620
As you get closer to the poles you get more
variation in

288
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,299
temperature seasonally, right? And in the
tropics it's shown here at zero

289
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:09,130
latitude. It's roughly the same temperature
all year around. And as you get

290
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:14,080
closer to the poles, either North or South,
you get more variation in

291
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,820
temperature because the summers are hotter
and the winters are colder. And this

292
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,460
graph shows differences between the northern
latitudes and the southern

293
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,220
latitudes. Southern latitudes, as, you know,
there's a lot more ocean than in

294
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,960
the northern latitudes. And so the variation,
seasonally, is less in the

295
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,580
southern latitudes than the northern latitudes.
We'll come back to this again

296
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,760
when we talk about primary productivity.

297
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,169
Any questions here? This should be largely
review. You're

298
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:49,669
probably wondering where this is leading.
Okay, it's leading to this. And the

299
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:55,950
point here is that the sun drives these big
patterns of air circulation around

300
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:02,410
the earth. That's important in determining
where on earth we have a lot of rain

301
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:09,410
and a lot of drought. It also determines the
direction of these, what we call,

302
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,179
prevailing winds. And it's those winds that
drive the ocean currents.

303
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:21,179
Okay, I'm going to explain a little bit about
this figure over

304
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,559
here.

305
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,480
Here is the earth. Here is the equator. North
and South. And

306
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,480
the sun is here. All right, so what this figure
is showing that, as the sun

307
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,789
heats up the equator, where the intensity
of light and heat will be most

308
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:59,559
intense, it will heat the air and the air
will rise. And those red arrows

309
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:06,160
turning into blue, air is rising at the equator.
And as the air rises, it

310
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,990
can't -- it cools, and it couldn't hold as
much moisture, and so that moisture

311
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:16,250
falls back to earth as precipitation. And
so that's why u-they equator, at that

312
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,559
region, you have more rain, and why it is
wetter in tropical regions.

313
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:27,970
Okay, so the air is up in the atmosphere and
it's cold and it

314
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:34,059
needs is someplace to go, and eventually it
returns to earth. And as it returns

315
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:40,240
to earth, it warms up and can absorb more
moisture. And it just so happens that

316
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,240
it's returning to earth around 30 degrees
North and South.

317
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,809
And so when it's returning to earth, it's
heating up, gaining

318
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:59,960
more moisture. And so those places on earth,
where the air is coming back to

319
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,870
earth, are drier. And that's shown in that
figure too. And so that's why it's

320
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,429
the case that all the major deserts and dry
areas are typically at 30 degrees

321
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,460
North and South latitude.

322
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:21,460
And then some of that air comes back towards
the equator along

323
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:29,230
the edge of the earth itself. And some is
going in the other direction. It

324
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,620
turns out there's another one of these large
air circulation patterns that

325
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:41,620
starts at about 60�, and some of it goes
up there. And also the same down

326
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,880
below. And what this figure should have shown,
is that the extent to which the

327
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,179
air moves up into the air because of the effect
of the sun is actually much

328
00:27:55,179 --> 00:28:01,970
greater at the equator than it is at the pole.
So those circulation graphs at

329
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:08,700
the poles actually should be a lot smaller.
They shouldn't go as far up into

330
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,350
the atmosphere as they do at the equator.

331
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,870
Okay, so the opponent is lots of sun at the
equator. So these

332
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:21,380
air circulation cells are really large. The
air comes back down at 30� North

333
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,809
and South, heats up of source moisture and
that's why you have the deserts at

334
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,610
those areas. Okay, the next thing to explain
is the prevailing winds and the

335
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,500
pattern of prevailing winds, and this is a
bit complicated.

336
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,500
I think your book does a good job of explaining
this, but the way

337
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:42,960
to think about it, I think, is that relative
to the speed of the earth, the air

338
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,750
can either move faster or slower than the
earth's rotation. And the other thing

339
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:54,750
to remember is that the earth, at least around
the equator in terms of latitude,

340
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,850
is the biggest at the equator. And the latitude
rings are smaller and smaller

341
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:06,850
as you get to the poles. So these winds that
are coming back from these desert

342
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:12,590
regions to the equator, from 30� North and
South, back to the equator, they're

343
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:18,490
actually having to traverse a larger distance
as they get closer to the equator.

344
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,520
So they start out at 30� North and South.
It's a pretty small ring at 30� North

345
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,470
and South latitude. And the equator is a much
bigger circle. So they actually

346
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:35,480
have to traverse a larger distance and as
a result, they appear to slow down

347
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,179
compared to the spin of the earth.

348
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:46,730
So the winds, at this latitude, North and
South, are moving in

349
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,150
that direction. And that's why those arrows,
for the prevailing winds, go in

350
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:56,159
that direction. And the reverse is true for
the winds moving northward from

351
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,020
30 degrees. So these winds, they're starting
at 30� North by they're moving to

352
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:09,020
a smaller latitude even farther North, so
they actually speed up relative to the

353
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:15,850
spin of the earth. So they're moving in that
direction. So you get patterns --

354
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:22,850
you get circulation patterns of winds in these
different areas. And that's

355
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,320
really important as we'll see in a second,
for driving these patterns of water

356
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,760
circulation. Okay, how are we doing? Is this
completely confusing? Any

357
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,770
questions about this? Yeah?

358
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,190
STUDENT: [Inaudible]

359
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:47,190
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'll take that back. They
would be higher. So

360
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,900
these are surface winds. I'll take those out
so it's not confusing. So the

361
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,110
surface winds are moving in this direction
[Indicating]. These are the winds

362
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:04,110
that are at higher altitudes. So let me just
summarize where we are. Lots of

363
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,900
heat at the equator. Because of that heat
at the equator, we get winds or we

364
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:16,950
get air masses rising, dumping the water.
That's why we have moisture at the

365
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:22,510
equator. When they come back down to earth,
they're absorbing moisture. And so

366
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:27,620
we have deserts at 30� North and South.
Those winds have to go somewhere. If

367
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:34,620
the winds from 30� are coming back to the
equator, it's a larger distance around

368
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:39,830
the equator than at 30�. So those winds
are slowing down a little bit. If the

369
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:44,520
winds are moving northward, it's a smaller
distance towards the poles. They're

370
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,830
speeding up on a bit. And that's what creates
these patterns of prevailing

371
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:55,250
winds on earth. Are we good? All right.

372
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:01,669
Well, the prevailing winds moving in this
way are driving the

373
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:07,309
ocean currents and if you sort of visualize
these wind patterns and I pop those

374
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:13,580
on the oceans, you can see that these ocean
currents are, in fact, following the

375
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,950
winds that are above. And I just would like
you to remember, just a few

376
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:24,950
currents here. So you can see what's happening
in the -- just a second here.

377
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,429
Let's just look at the North Pacific here.
You can see that

378
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:34,980
these, because of these prevailing winds,
you get what we call gyres, big masses

379
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,020
of water moving around the Pacific. And if
you've seen the movie Finding Nemo,

380
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,220
you know all about this. And in the southern
hemisphere, you see the same

381
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,779
thing, but moving in the other direction.
And this is really important for

382
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:54,150
biology and for nutrients and productivity
which we'll come back to.

383
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,380
And along our coast here in North America,
we have a current

384
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:03,830
coming down. Because of this gyre, we have
a current coming down here from

385
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,500
Alaska. That's called the California current.
And that's a cold current. I

386
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,880
would like you to remember that name and that
current. We'll come back to that.

387
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,380
On the east coast we have a gyre moving this
direction and the

388
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,490
Gulf Stream is the main current along the
east coast. That's a warm current

389
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,980
because it's deforming the Caribbean. And
the only other current I would like

390
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:31,929
you to remember is, there's a current that's
going actually along Antarctica,

391
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:36,190
and it's not -- this figure doesn't show it
that well, because it also shows a

392
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,059
current closer to the shore going in the other
direction, but that's also a

393
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:45,860
current I would like you to remember. This
Antarctic circumpolar current that's

394
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:52,860
actually spinning all the way around at the
bottom of the earth.

395
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,390
So I would like you to remember these three
currents: California

396
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,850
current, a cold current coming down from Alaska,
really important for our

397
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,110
fisheries, which we'll talk about; the Gulf
Stream, a warm current coming from

398
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,700
the Caribbean; and our Antarctic circumpolar
current, which is actually going

399
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:18,149
unhindered all the way around the earth below
South America and below Australia.

400
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:24,510
Okay, are we good on that? So I don't expect
you to memorize all

401
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,480
those currents. Just know that the prevailing
winds are driving the directions

402
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:36,200
of these currents in the ocean. And both of
these patterns of circulation, both

403
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,669
for the winds and the oceans, make predictions
about where we would expect

404
00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:45,389
organisms to be. If organisms are being disbursed
by winds or by the ocean

405
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:50,089
currents then we would expect them to move
around the world, following these

406
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:55,260
currents. And it's that kind of dispersal
actually, that I study largely in

407
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,369
collaboration with my wife, Rosie Gillespie.
And I'm going to spend the rest of

408
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:05,369
the time talking about that. One more thing
first. Sorry I forgot this.

409
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,470
In addition to these global patterns of winds
and prescription,

410
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:14,450
there are also more local patterns that are
caused by the shape of the earth or

411
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,770
the topography. And the topography also matters.
I think we're in a great spot

412
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,849
to see that here in the Bay Area. Here is
a graph actually from your book,

413
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:29,770
showing the Pacific Ocean and the winds coming
from the ocean moving uphill.

414
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:33,770
And as we talked about before, as air rises
it can't how old as much moisture so

415
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:40,770
it dumps that moisture here in Berkeley or
Marin County, Santa Cruz.

416
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,450
And then on the other side of the hills here,
as, you know, in

417
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:48,520
Walnut Creek and Orinda, it's a lot drier.
So the Central Valley is dry because

418
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,260
the winds have gone uphill and have dumped
the moisture before they got to the

419
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,070
Central Valley. We call that a rain shadow.

420
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,609
And this rain shadow effect is really pronounced
in California.

421
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:05,660
In fact, the whole western U.S. So here is
a map of California. We have the

422
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,890
winds coming from the west. They have to go
over the coast range and then over

423
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:15,180
the hills here at Berkeley. As a result, as
shown here in different colors, is

424
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:21,010
the amount of rain, but you can see as the
rain goes over these mountains by

425
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:26,200
Santa Cruz here as shown.

426
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Here is Santa Cruz area and then Marin County
area, and then even

427
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:40,240
farther North in Humble. You can see that
the rain is falling on these regions

428
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:47,570
because of the topography there, the rise
in the mountains, the rain gets dumped

429
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,160
on those mountains. And it was on the other
side shown here in the Central

430
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,220
Valley and then just over the hill in Orinda
and Walnut Creek. It gets a lot

431
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,760
drier. And we see the same thing here in the
Sierras. Here are the Sierras

432
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,150
shown in blue.

433
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,440
As the winds bring precipitation over the
Sierras, there, again,

434
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,020
the air is forced on rise, it cools, colder
air can't how old as much moisture,

435
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,740
so it dumps rain and, hopefully, snow in the
Sierras. And then on the other

436
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:24,619
side it's dry. We have a desert. And we see
this again also, in the Rockies

437
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:31,150
here through the middle of the western U.S.
where the air has to go over the

438
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:34,770
Rockies. And what's left of all that precipitation
gets dumped on the Rockies

439
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:41,770
and then over on the other side of the Rockies
it's quite dry. All right.

440
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:48,900
So back to these predictions. We have now,
a set of patterns,

441
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,320
wind currents and ocean currents and we know
a little bit about topography. And

442
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:58,400
we can hypothesize that if organisms are disbursing
to get to new habitats, then

443
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,349
we ought to be able to detect that. And not
only that, but the mechanisms of

444
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:08,280
dispersal that match either wind movements
or water currents, we ought to be

445
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,810
able to pick that up as well.

446
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,530
So I've been involved in on a number of studies
looking at,

447
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:18,480
especially invasive species across the Hawaiian
Islands. And as you're probably

448
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,530
aware, the Hawaiian Islands were colonized
-- not that many times -- by all

449
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:28,260
kinds of different things including Hawaiian
Honeycreepers here for Hawaii,

450
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,599
spiders, Silver sort of plants that Bruce
Baldwin works on at Berkeley. Do you

451
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,250
know about the Galapagos and the Galapagos
Finches? And we'll return to the

452
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,920
Galapagos Finches in later lectures.

453
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,210
So we can ask: Well, what predictions can
we make? Where did

454
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,300
the organisms come from, that are found on
these Islands? And we can predict

455
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,530
that: Well, if they came from -- if they disburse
by air, then they ate to come

456
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:58,530
from places predicted by these wind currents.
If they came through ocean

457
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,420
currents then they ought to have come from
places predicted by the ocean

458
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:07,589
currents. Topography is also important, even
in the Pacific.

459
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:12,470
So here, for example, is a map showing the
amount of prescription

460
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:16,960
across the Islands of Hawaii, the Big Island
here on the lower right. And you

461
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,780
can see that parts of these Islands are wetter
than others. And this is

462
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:28,140
predicted by the prevailing winds that are
bringing moisture and winds across

463
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:34,030
the Pacific. When they hit these Islands,
the air, again, rises and dumps

464
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,430
moisture, but only on certain sides of the
island.

465
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:42,589
So on certain sides of the island you have
wet, moist habitats.

466
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:46,760
That's me, Rosie and our kids some years ago.
Our kids are now your age. In

467
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,980
fact, some of you know them.

468
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,030
And on the dry Islands -- dry part of the
island, you get

469
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,820
habitats that look like this. They didn't
turn out to be biologists, either of

470
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:03,109
them, I should say. Too many field trips and
not enough surfing.

471
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:08,980
Okay, so if we look at the patterns of prevailing
winds, shown in

472
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:15,520
white, some storms, light-blue, these big
hurricanes. And the jet streams, we

473
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,770
can make some predictions about where these
organisms should have --

474
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,020
[VIDEO]

475
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,510
NARRATOR: It's just a spider -- get out of
the egg sack and then

476
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:30,010
they will go up something, like up to the
top of a branch or something. And

477
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,260
then --

478
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,160
PROFESSOR: You know, I'm going to start that
over again.

479
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,300
[VIDEO]

480
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,570
NARRATOR: It's just a spider link, see, get
out of the egg sack

481
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:45,000
and then they will go up something, like,
up to the top of a branch arrow

482
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,240
something. And then they'll put their little
abdomens up in the air and let

483
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,859
silk out. The wind will pull on the silk and
it will pull more and more as they

484
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:58,240
let more silk out. And then they'll finally
take off kind of like Mary Poppins

485
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,760
takes off with their umbrella, and they'll
just sail up into the air.

486
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,760
PROFESSOR: Okay. So for these spiders -- for
these spiders that

487
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,450
are disbursing because they balloon by putting
up a little piece of silk,

488
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,010
they're patterns of biogeography and their
origins are predicted by these winds.

489
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:25,050
They come from North America as you might
expect from the prevailing winds.

490
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:32,050
The situation is a little bit different -- the
situation -- wait,

491
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:39,369
can you -- I can't tell how loud I am. Can
you hear me? Okay. The situation

492
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,589
is -- I can't tell if you can hear me. Is
it good? Okay.

493
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:47,460
The situation is a bit different for birds
because birds, not

494
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:53,240
only are effected by winds, but some are migratory.
For migratory birds, some

495
00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:00,000
of them are using the Pacific Islands and
pooping on places on migrations from

496
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,820
the Arctic, even sometimes to the Antarctic,
but certainly across the Pacific.

497
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,140
So some of the bird origins are predicted
by these migratory pathways.

498
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:17,140
Many of the forest birds, however, show a
lot of affinities with

499
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:24,260
the Americas. And it's thought that this comes
as a result of these fly ways of

500
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:31,260
birds up and down the Pacific Coast. And it's
likely that, through storms or

501
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:38,790
somehow, these birds got pushed out into the
ocean accidentally once in a while

502
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:44,770
and that's likely what's responsible for the
birds that have come into these

503
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:50,790
Islands in the Pacific, like the Galapagos
Finches and the birds in Hawaii, and

504
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,550
cause these adaptive radiations shown there
above.

505
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,070
And in Hawaii, some of these are really dramatic.
This is a set

506
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,770
of Hawaii Hawaiian Honeycreepers that are
actual related to the North American

507
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:07,109
Cedar Waxwings. And it's a great example of
adaptive radiation, which you

508
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:13,440
talked about the already in your evolution
section.

509
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Okay, these birds that come from the North
and the South and use

510
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,470
these Islands for fly ways are also bringing
other organisms. So, for example,

511
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:32,900
the birds eat seeds and if they have to pooped
out those seeds before they get

512
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,770
to the Islands, then it's a way of disbursing
those plants. It's also a way of

513
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,099
disbursing organisms that are feeding inside
those seeds. And so it turns out

514
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:49,349
that many of the moths that are seed feeders
in these Islands, like Hawaii, were

515
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:55,890
probably disbursed inside these seeds and
inside birds from the northern -- from

516
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,619
boreal regions into the Pacific.

517
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,839
You don't have to remember all these details.
This is just

518
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:08,210
background information. The ocean currents
are also make some predictions for

519
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:14,140
intertidal organisms, and also for those organisms
that raft on big mats of

520
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:19,970
vegetation that sometimes get dislodged and
move across the Pacific. Here are

521
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,950
just some examples.

522
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:27,320
That one picture there, the lower right photo
is an example of a

523
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,740
mat of vegetation that's floating in the Caribbean.
And researchers actually

524
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,520
found lizards on that mat. And that's how
some of these bigger organisms,

525
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,380
there's a beetle that moved across the Pacific
and a very large spider, that

526
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,349
moved to the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. That's
probably how these big large

527
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:52,349
animals that don't fly, how they're able to
get to some of these remote Islands.

528
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,369
For good or bad, other things are moving around
the Pacific and

529
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:05,510
the Atlantic, and other oceans of the world.
There's a lot of trash in these

530
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:11,109
oceans, as you might be aware. And the trash
accumulates into these big mats

531
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:16,430
and it's a place where many organisms, essentially
invasive species can live and

532
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:23,000
disburse around the world. And scientists
are actively studying these mats of

533
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
vegetation. In this case, largely human caused,
debris masses as a way to

534
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,290
understand dispersal patterns of organisms
around the earth.

535
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:42,290
And probably the best example of this...the
best example of this

536
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:51,710
is a boat load of Nike sneakers that accidentally
fell overboard in the 1990s.

537
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:00,349
And also another example is a tub of plastic
toys. And there's a group of

538
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:04,520
people, it's a citizen science group that's
tracking these sorts of things

539
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:11,520
around the earth. So here, for example, are
the sneakers. They fell off a boat

540
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:17,210
here in the northern Pacific. Number one there
in 1990.

541
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:23,020
And then they were found months later, and
it was years later

542
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:30,020
here in Hawaii and also back in Asia as a
result of these currents. And

543
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:35,880
scientists actually used this information
as a way to figure out how these

544
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,260
currents take place and how marine organisms
can live and be disbursed at such

545
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,349
great distances throughout the earth.

546
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:49,670
Okay, so some of the people who do this work
at Berkeley, in case

547
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,430
you're interested in more of this kind of
thing: Rosie Gillespie, my wife and

548
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:00,800
also professor in ESPM, and she studies spiders
and community biology; Bruce

549
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,440
Baldwin, who is in Integrated Biology, and
he works on plants, especially Silver

550
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,910
Swords and their relatives in Hawaii; Ian
Wong, a young professor -- a new

551
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:16,420
professor in ESPM who works on landscape ecology
and distributions of

552
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:21,880
vertebrates, especially in California, including
salamanders and lizards. And I

553
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,339
work on insects and invasions.

554
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:29,630
Okay, I just want to point this out before
I let you go. So at

555
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,579
the end of each lecture I'll have the terms
and concepts that I expect you to

556
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:38,069
know. Most of these are in the book. Some
are not in the book and when they're

557
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:43,210
not in the book I try to write them on the
board, but this is the set up of

558
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,890
things that I really expect you to know for
each lecture.

559
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:50,220
Okay, good luck on Wednesday and we'll see
you next week.
