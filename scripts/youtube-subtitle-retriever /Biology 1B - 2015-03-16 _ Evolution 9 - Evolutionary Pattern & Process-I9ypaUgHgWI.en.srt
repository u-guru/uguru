1
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:09,379
PROFESSOR: All right. We are continuing with
the discussion of the broader patterns

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:16,500
of evolution. The next, this lecture and the
next lecture are covering similar grounds

3
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:18,839
in

4
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:24,859
a macroevolutionary context, that's what we're
building up to. And your final lab in this

5
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:31,859
section of the course is on macroevolution
using examples from horses. And I'll introduce

6
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:39,899
that today, these examples of horse evolution
to help introduce that lab.

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,490
This week is your final lab in phylogenetics,
right, with the primate phylogenetics?

8
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,730
You've already had some intro primates, so
some feedback there.

9
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,730
I'll talk about adaptive radiation which has
come up already, this whole idea of new

10
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:05,190
lineages forming in island contexts that so
stimulated Darwin and his contemporaries.

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,659
And

12
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,490
I'll look at some examples on how it sheds
light on evolutionary pattern and process,

13
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:20,490
evolutionary tempo and mode which are traditional
terms. A phrase, a book written by one

14
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:27,979
of the architects of the modern synthesis,
Tempo and Mode in Evolution by Simpson. Tempo

15
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:35,700
referring to the rate of evolution. Mode referring
to the shape of evolution. And we'll

16
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,639
try to unpack what all that means.

17
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:44,469
And then introduce punctuated equilibrium
which is something you may have heard of.

18
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:49,789
It's, at least it was part of popular culture.
You can still see cars in Berkeley with

19
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:55,869
bumper stickers that say "Honk if you look
punk eek" which is a reference to punctuated

20
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,609
equilibrium. Those were more popular. Those
bumper stickers may be in the 1980s, but

21
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:07,609
hey, it's still very much a current source
of study relating to the shape of evolution.

22
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,640
We'll talk about that and the tempo.

23
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,560
And then we'll look at another question that
we opened up earlier on, how complex

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,910
adaptations arise in evolution. For example,
the eye. We'll look at the eye example, the

25
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,330
one that Darwin was challenged on. How can
such a complex structure such as the eye

26
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,140
evolve?

27
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:39,140
And we'll look at mechanisms of evolution
involving exaptation and tinkering, this

28
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,590
concept of working with what's available rather
than inventing things from, inventing

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,100
things anew. Working with what's available
and then thus, innovating with the materials

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,830
at hand. That's part of those concepts.

31
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,300
All right. All of the these things today.

32
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,300
And then looking at islands now, let me see
if I can get, because this is a cool

33
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,680
recent video. I don't have the credit up here.
I'll get the credit onto your slides.

34
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,680
But a recent video showing the birth of islands
in ocean, literally, in, you know in

35
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:28,770
realtime, the way volcanos erupt under water
and that molten lava cooling with the, in

36
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,130
contact with the water can form new islands,
right? And this is the, how the Galapagos

37
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,500
were formed. It's how the Hawaiian Islands
are formed through this process. And you

38
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,800
know, these volcanos are essentially under
water mountains, volcanos, from the sea floor.

39
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,850
They can be extremely tall. If you drained
the ocean, you'd have an extremely tall

40
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,850
volcano, peaking its head up above the ocean
surface, right? So that's how literally

41
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,410
islands may evolve. And that's the story of
the Hawaiian Islands.

42
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,260
Your big island here, Hawaii, is the youngest
in this archipelago. The oldest

43
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,260
islands are to the Northwest. Right? And the
idea here, it relates to plate tectonics.

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,220
But in a some what unique way from the way
plate tectonics functions to create volcanos

45
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,490
at

46
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,310
the continental shelves, this is an archipelago
that's far from the continents. And the

47
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,310
hypothesis is that the Pacific plate in moving
in this direction is passing over a hotspot

48
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:51,130
deep under the lith, lithosphere. And so the
plate in moving over a deep hotspot

49
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,910
creates volcanic activity, and as a result
of plates' movements, the older islands get

50
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,560
carried toward the Northwest. And the younger
islands form down here in the southeast.

51
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,180
Thus, the ancient nature of these relative
to these.

52
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,590
And what's happened on the Hawaiian island,
they're relatively young. What's

53
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,510
happened is that you've had adaptive radiations
of the nature that Darwin was interested

54
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,740
in that I've described multiple times in the
patterning of island hopping of species.

55
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:31,740
And drosophila, the fruit flies famous for
the work on laboratory genetics on these

56
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:37,440
organisms, have speciated like crazy on the
Hawaiian Islands. So it's a spectacular

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,440
example of adaptive radiation. Specifically
these drosophila flies are radiating based

58
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:44,930
on

59
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:51,740
differences in where they lay their eggs.
Some are laying eggs on fungi. Some are laying

60
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,560
them on the leaves of plants. Some on the
stems of plants. They have differentiated

61
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,810
the

62
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:04,630
habitat in relation to their reproductive
activity. And created differences in that

63
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,110
regard that allow them to coexist.

64
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,160
And they've hopped from island to island and
changed along the way. Don't worry

65
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,960
about the numbers that are on this figure.
I just like the figure but the numbers are

66
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,310
inconsequential.

67
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:25,310
Another example from Hawaii, this modest little
plant, a tarweed from California or

68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,360
from North America got to Hawaii and radiated
there. A little plant like this that has an

69
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,180
opportunity to travel that great distance
successfully may find itself on new islands

70
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,430
with

71
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:47,949
very few competitors, with very few established
large photosynthetic organisms with which

72
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:54,949
to compete. And is subjected to all the evolutionary
forces we've looked at. And has a

73
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,229
great opportunity in such a circumstance.
And that little creature having arrived has

74
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:07,660
radiated into all these forms, into these
mounding forms, into these leafy herbaceous

75
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:14,660
forms, into forms that look like, you know,
agave or maybe cactus-like forms, into small

76
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:22,030
trees or woody shrubs. All these variations
in morphology and ecology resulting from

77
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,620
ecological opportunities in this new landscape.

78
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,430
Here you have ages on the islands, showing
Hawaii with an estimated age of less than

79
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,760
half a million years. It's relatively young.
Would that have been, you know, and if you

80
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,930
think of these creatures having evolved in
this span of time, the oldest over 5 million

81
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,150
down to a million down to a half million,
well, is that timescale long enough in Darwinian

82
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,389
terms for evolutionary processes like this
to happen? Well, yeah. It must be because

83
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,740
that's how old the islands are and this is
the type of radiation you see.

84
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,590
These organisms don't exist anywhere else.
They don't exist on any other, on the

85
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,639
continents. There's no evidence that they
ever did. They're endemic to the Hawaiian

86
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,020
archipelago.

87
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:21,020
So certainly evolution can happen on that,
that span, scale of time. That span of

88
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,900
time.

89
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,590
Can it happen even faster? There's good evidence
from other settings that it can.

90
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:37,360
And I'm speaking of organisms like plants
and vertebrates here. But, let's not forget

91
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,490
about something like bacteria. We've been
hearing a lot in the news recently about super,

92
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:49,490
super bugs in hospitals, right? Antibiotic
resistant infections in hospitals. If you

93
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:56,920
haven't been reading the news, that it has
been widely in the news for years now. And

94
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,920
that's evolution that's occurring as these
organisms adapt to tolerate antibiotics in

95
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:13,430
hospital contexts or in medical contexts.
And that's evolution on a really rapid scale

96
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,010
in

97
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,010
bacteria, for example, which have very fast
generation times, very short generation times,

98
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:24,149
and rapid evolutionary potential.

99
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,080
Well, how about something like vertebrates
here? It's easier to understand the

100
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,000
rapidity in bacteria, but vertebrates, fish?
How quickly can fish evolve a bunch of

101
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
species? These African lakes function, they
function as islands. Thus, I had quotes in,

102
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,200
on islands in one of the earlier slides. Because
these lakes are essentially islands of

103
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,200
water in a sea of land if you will. Right?
They're isolated habitats in a different type

104
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,570
of habitat.

105
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:04,570
So lakes like these, Lake Malawi, Tanganyika,
in the East African rift, in the East

106
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,600
African Rift Valley, and lakes in the eastern
branch of the Rift Valley, and the giant

107
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Lake Victoria that sits in between these rifts,
these lakes have been islands in which

108
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,540
evolution has occurred, specifically of cichlids
-- cichlid fish which have come up

109
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,540
previously -- to the tune of evolving four
to 500 species in these lakes which is a lot

110
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:34,770
of

111
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,360
species.

112
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,940
If you compare the Great Lakes of North America,
Lake Superior, that might have 20 to

113
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:46,510
30 species of fish in it. These lakes have
400, 500 cichlids alone. Forget all the

114
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:53,510
catfish and all the other fish. They're incredibly
speciose. Well, when did that happen?

115
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,370
These rift lakes are deep and ancient. Malawi
and Tanganyika are deep and ancient. They

116
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:07,370
hold a large quantity of the world's freshwater,
the whole planet's freshwater. So much

117
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,240
of the planet's freshwater is just in these
two lakes and Lake Biakal because of how deep

118
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,940
they are. And they're old.

119
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,680
So that could have happened on a great timescale.
But Lake Victoria, this is a

120
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,680
shallow lake that's formed by ponding up,
damming up rivers in the relatively recent

121
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,980
past.

122
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,750
Like maybe 40,000 years ago, 40- to 50,000
years ago. And then it seems to have dried

123
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,020
up

124
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:43,020
completely 14,000 years ago. So you'd have
almost as many cichlids in this lake as in

125
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:50,820
these. And that seems to have occurred in
that span of time. On a scale of 10, 20,000

126
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,220
years.

127
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:59,220
Or a little lake called Lake Nagu, Nagubob,
Nabugabo, I always pronounce wrong.

128
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,670
N-A-B-A-G-U-B-O. Not important, but that's
a picture of Nabugabo right

129
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,649
there. It's a fascinating little laboratory
of evolution. It's a little lake off of Lake

130
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:16,209
Victoria formed by a, dunes that formed and
separated it from Lake Victoria. This thing's

131
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:23,209
only a few thousand years old, Lake Nabugabo.
And in it you've had a radiation of

132
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:30,649
cichlids. So thousands of years for the evolution
of different vertebrate species.

133
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:36,310
These fishes are unique maybe in they're capacity
to evolve quickly. They have

134
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:42,170
adaptations in their jaws. They have unique
structure of their jaws that allows them to

135
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:49,170
differentiate their feeding niches in specialized
ways. I wouldn't go into the details,

136
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:57,560
but it involves of separation of pharyngeal
jaws into two parts that allows them to

137
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,420
capture food and chew food with separate mechanisms.

138
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:09,420
And they have complex modes of signaling in
sexual selection contexts. Unique

139
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,420
features that probably allow them to speciate
quickly relative to some other organisms.

140
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:22,410
So these aspects of their biology that create
a tempo of evolution that's rapid.

141
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:28,860
But a few thousand years is fast in Darwinian
terms. Darwin thought that things took

142
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,640
much longer or at least that's the typical
interpretation of Darwin's ideas.

143
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:42,640
A phyletic gradualism, right? Gradualism is
a phrase we've linked to him before.

144
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,100
Change by insensible degrees. So we can think
of Darwin as ascribing to a tempo of

145
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:02,089
evolution of that nature. And that would lead
to a particular shape of evolution. A slow

146
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:07,579
gradual changing in morphology. I'll have
a couple of diagrams in a minute that can

147
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:07,829
help

148
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,040
illustrate what shape that would imply.

149
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,519
But remember the problem for the fossil record
that that suggested because fossils

150
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,519
don't always show those clean links in form,
illustrating slow, gradual changes. So he

151
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,240
had a problem on his hands that he answered
by saying, well it's just a bad record. The

152
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,240
geological record is poor and doesn't capture
all those fine changes.

153
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,950
A big innovation occurred when, with a, with
the notion of punctuated equilibrium. A

154
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:50,950
theoretical innovation, a creative set of
ideas on the part of Stephen Gould and Niles

155
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:59,190
Eldredge. Names aren't important here, but
well-known investigators from the late 20th

156
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:00,510
century.

157
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,930
And Gould and Eldredge looked at the very
same evidence that everyone else had looked

158
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,930
at in terms of the fossil record and the distribution
of forms across strata over time.

159
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,010
And they took the record literally. And said,
well, what if this is a decent record?

160
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:26,010
What if it's not just a broken record here
and the data are sufficient for an analysis

161
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,120
of

162
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,649
how evolution unfolded? They reasoned that
in short periods of time, it's possible that

163
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:40,649
in short periods of time represented by a
single stratum, you might have had a lot of

164
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,240
change occur in form. And then over longer
periods of time, you would have periods of

165
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,240
stasis, S-T-A-S-I-S. Stasis, where relatively
little change occurred. So long

166
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,820
periods of equilibrium punctuated by rapid
periods of change.

167
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,930
And that's a really different interpretation
from the interpretation of phyletic

168
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:13,930
gradualism and signified a different shape
to the evolutionary process.

169
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:20,990
Stasis, long-term stasis is familiar in, for
organisms in the fossil record. Many

170
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,690
organisms represent long, long periods of
stasis and are sometimes called living fossils,

171
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,920
although it's a problematic descriptor. But
horseshoe crabs like these, you can see them

172
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,339
on beaches today, sometimes breeding in massive
numbers. Has anyone ever been on a beach

173
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:44,990
where the horseshoe crabs are breeding? Yeah.
A few of you? Was it on the East Coast,

174
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,500
the Atlantic Ocean? Do you remember where
it was?

175
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,790
STUDENT: North Carolina.

176
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,089
PROFESSOR: North Carolina.

177
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:51,950
STUDENT: Cancun.

178
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,880
PROFESSOR: Cancun. Yeah. It happens around
the world. It's typical of the eastern

179
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,320
U.S. and the Atlantic seaboard. These guys
are useful in medical research too. So

180
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:08,320
they're highly sought for their, their unique
type of blood. But still doing okay. But

181
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,870
readily harvested. And these things were basically,
look at this guy from the Jurassic,

182
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,429
175 million years ago. Well it's a horseshoe
crab. You can see it from a distance. It's

183
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:25,480
still a horseshoe crab. Barely changed its
overall form. Now it could be a carnival at

184
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,090
the molecular level in terms of changes. We
can't see what's happening at the molecular

185
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,980
level from a fossil like this in comparison
to an organism like this. So there could be

186
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,230
a

187
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:41,230
lot of change happening at other levels. But
in gross morphology, long-term stasis here.

188
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:47,020
This is longer term stasis than was even considered
by the, by Gould and Eldredge. But

189
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,280
examples of extreme forms of stasis.

190
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,110
Or the Dawn redwood trees, which you were
probably introduced to in the last section,

191
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,960
right? Metasequoia, a relative of redwoods
and sequoias, that was only recently

192
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,150
discovered. It's a great story. Recent discovery
in China in the 1940s. A grove of

193
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,160
these trees was found. Soon after it had been
described from the fossil record from the

194
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,140
Mesozoic, from dinosaur times, terrestrial
dinosaur times, the fossils of these had been

195
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,570
found and described and then a few years later,
a living stand of them was found growing

196
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,669
in these ravines, these remote ravines in
China. And then World War II happened and

197
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,919
there

198
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:34,770
was a delay. And after global situation calmed
down, an expedition was run from, from

199
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,100
Harvard of scientists to go collect seeds
of it. And so you have, you have these trees

200
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,350
on

201
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,870
the Berkeley campus. Several of them, right
around the building in the vicinity of

202
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:50,270
building. And some of them date to that time
because these seeds were taken and the

203
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:56,520
Harvard biologists sent them to different
universities and arboreta to plant. And it

204
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:56,770
was

205
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,850
a remarkable case of an ancient form for which
the record was lost for many millions of

206
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:09,850
years that was found to still exist today.
It's a living fossil that hasn't changed its

207
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:17,790
form to too great an extent over time over
time. Vast period of equilibrium.

208
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:24,049
Darwin seemed to imply that organisms would
constantly change. If this is morphology

209
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:31,049
on this axis, and this is time on this axis,
then your morphological features are going

210
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,440
to

211
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:39,270
gradually drift over time and slowly. And
sometimes the drifting will involve a branching

212
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:46,880
as to lineages split and become different
things, sufficiently different that they don't

213
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,580
maintain their integrity as one line but become
two lines. This is called anagenetic

214
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:00,580
change. Just write it on the board instead
of fighting with my, my tablet to do it.

215
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Anagenesis. Anagenesis refers to that type
of change in lineages that occurs through

216
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,450
the

217
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,280
gradual changes through time and can lead
to must forms. As opposed to cladogenesis

218
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,090
where

219
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:38,350
the changes are concentrated at the branching,
at the branching events them.

220
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,350
So here with the same axes, let's take a look
at this with the same axes, right? If

221
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:53,620
this is morphological change, that's a great
amount of morphological change occurring in

222
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:00,620
no time at all, because time is on your y-axis,
right? So here's a lineage that's living

223
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:08,789
through time in stasis. This would represent
stasis. No morphological change. Rapid

224
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,799
amount of morphological change in virtually
no time at all. At least with reference to

225
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,490
the geological record and its ability to capture
these phenomena. And then ongoing

226
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:28,490
stasis. So equilibrium punctuated by a lot
of change and more equilibrium.

227
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,580
The shape of this is different from the shape
of this. This is rectangular in form.

228
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,380
The branching pattern, it's squared. It's
you know 90-degree angles. Sometimes called

229
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:49,240
rectangular. And it's cladogenesis, where
the clades arise rapidly in time. And the

230
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,690
changes concentrate, concentrated at the lineage
branching event. Here the change occurs

231
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:02,049
all along as well as at the branching event.
Here it's concentrated at the splitting

232
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:06,370
events them.

233
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:12,240
And that's really a gradualism contrasted
with punctuated equilibrium. Let's put

234
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,910
some organisms on it for reference. Butterflies
that have different color patterns.

235
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:24,169
Right? So different gross morphology, different
form of these butterflies. Here's, from

236
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:29,770
starting from this relatively muted brown
butterfly in the gradualism model, they would

237
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:35,990
gradually change, form over time, becoming
more orange here. Maybe with some white bands

238
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,080
here until they ended up as different forms.
Here's your original dull model in a

239
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:48,080
punctuated equilibrium context that branches
to form an orange type and some other type

240
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,210
relatively quickly. Different shapes to the
process, leading to an end result that may

241
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:54,559
be

242
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,559
similar, an orange one and a white one and
maybe your original type as well. "Punk eek."

243
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:10,160
The real geeks will say "punk eek", that's
shorthand for punctuated equilibrium. Yes,

244
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,280
please.

245
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,330
STUDENT: So what's a bigger factor of rapid
gene flow or just rapid [inaudible]

246
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,660
PROFESSOR: So what's a bigger factor in the
punctuated equilibrium model? Is it a

247
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,850
lack of gene flow or some other mechanism?
Yeah, it's a great question because what

248
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,980
you're getting at is the question I think
as to whether the mechanisms are different

249
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,230
in

250
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:41,100
punctuated equilibrium vs. gradualism. And
that really was the heart of the debate

251
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,720
because when this model was advanced by Gould
and Eldredge, it was taken to be

252
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:56,720
anti-Darwinian. Some non-Darwinian mechanisms
must be responsible for this model to work.

253
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:07,179
And mostly they said no, we're just talking
about traditional Darwinian mechanisms on

254
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,250
different timescales and concentrated in different
portions of the evolution of these

255
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:20,250
lineages. So they didn't introduce any new
mechanisms of change.

256
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:28,500
There are results from recent times, particularly
in the field of evolutionary

257
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,500
developmental biology, evo-devo, evolutionary
developmental biology that I'll look at in

258
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,500
the next lecture that can help explain periods
of very rapid change that are in some ways

259
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:50,110
non-Darwinian maybe. And also types of genetic
change that, that can lead in single

260
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,600
generations to lineage splitting that we've
already looked at with cases of polyploidy.

261
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,330
Phenomena like that are relevant here maybe,
for some lineages at least. But mostly, the

262
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:13,330
punctuated equilibrium folks were saying,
no, we're talking about traditional mechanisms.

263
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:19,880
This was a study right in the heart of that
debate that seemed to support a

264
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,990
punctuated equilibrium model. Again these
Great Lakes of Africa. In this case molluscs

265
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:32,890
and the shape of the evolution of the mollusc
tree in these African lakes. Looking at

266
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:38,490
fossils, an excellent fossil record going
way back in time. These organisms seemed to

267
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:45,340
have periods of stasis punctuated by rapid
change, continued by periods of stasis. There

268
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:52,340
was just an example of support for punctuated
equilibrium that was published in a, you

269
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:56,150
know, in the major journal of the world nature
and received a lot of press. It's also

270
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,960
received significant challenges since then.
But there was and is evidence to support a

271
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,260
punctuated equilibrium model.

272
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,610
Just a reminder about the doors. I've had
multiple requests to try not to slam doors

273
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:14,360
on your way out and in. Those things slam
and can be disruptive.

274
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,690
Horses are really interesting case study in
this context. And they'll be the focus

275
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:25,690
of your lab next week. This is a, horses have
been studied in evolutionary contexts for

276
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,450
a

277
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,750
long, long time. Textbook sort of example.
There's a lecture this morning, 10:00 a.m.

278
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,000
on

279
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,820
this campus, in this building on the evolution
of horses. So if you want the details on

280
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:44,630
that, it starts at 10:00. And it's taking
a genomic approach to modern horses. But the

281
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,309
data shed light on these ancient patterns
in interesting ways.

282
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:53,450
So the horses are just fas -- horses are fascinating
to people, the beloved noble

283
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,049
horse. Right? Where would we be today without
horses? Well they did play a huge role in

284
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:05,049
our history. They evolved from modest little
creatures, you know the size of a, the size

285
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:12,159
of a dog, these ancient horses from 60 million
years ago, Eohippus. The Dawn horse.

286
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:19,409
Hippus refers to horse. Hippopotamus is the
river horse. Eohippus, Eo, ancient Dawn,

287
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,320
from the earliest days, the ancient horse.
Well these guys were, yeah, they were tiny,

288
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,700
like this. And they had lots of toes. Well
not lots. I mean five or fewer is typical

289
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,700
for vertebrates. And these guys had four good
toes on their feet. And over time you have

290
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:47,340
this trend over increasing size and loss of
toes to the modern condition where your noble

291
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,650
horses just running on its middle fingers
and middle toes. It's running on one finger.

292
00:27:53,650 --> 00:28:00,650
Indeed it's running on the distal bone and
hoof of the one finger. The others having

293
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:03,500
been

294
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,320
reduced and lost completely or just present
as these little splints, which if you're an

295
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,000
equestrian you know about horses that they
have these two bones on either side which

296
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
represent the vestiges of the ancient bones
of digit two and digit four that, that have

297
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,480
essentially gone away.

298
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,490
Not only has height changed and the number
of toes changed, but the tooth form has

299
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:36,490
changed from the ancient types that had relatively
low crowned teeth, the portion of the

300
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,950
tooth that's above the gum line is the crown,
and the roots below that, well, this is a

301
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,799
low crowned tooth because there's a relatively
small amount of crown relative to the

302
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:55,360
roots. It's about equal. That's low crowned.
As opposed to a high crowned tooth like

303
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,350
your modern horse has in the barnyard, it
has a very high crown and only a little bit

304
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,740
of

305
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,630
root. This is all the root right there. All
the rest is crown.

306
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:14,400
And these three phenomena, height, size, number
of toes, and heights of teeth have

307
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,200
been part of an integrated story of horse
evolution. Does anyone know the general

308
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,440
contours of that story? What do all these
three things relate to in horses? Or maybe

309
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,720
you

310
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,360
can just present a hypothesis. Maybe you've
never heard but ... can you generate any

311
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,360
creative idea there? A roomful of geniuses.
I know there's stirring minds out there but,

312
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,409
yes.

313
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,870
STUDENT: [inaudible]

314
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:50,029
PROFESSOR: Teeth had to do with a change in
diet. Yes, they did. And an emphasis

315
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:57,029
on foods that are harder to chew. Specifically
grasses. Grass is really hard to chew if

316
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:03,929
you've ever tried compared to leaves or fruit,
which these little guys probably were

317
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,929
emphasizing in more forested contexts, leaves
and fruits, grasses are full of silica.

318
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,690
They're impregnated with silica. The stuff
that sand or glass is made from, right, and

319
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,870
that wears away the teeth. So you better have
a high crown of, on your teeth if you're

320
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,220
going to wear it that much or you'll wear
them out and you won't be able to chew any

321
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,510
more.

322
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,260
And that can happen to horses.

323
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:38,260
So high crowned teeth correlated with eating
grass in open spaces where running is at

324
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:45,480
a premium. Being tall with long legs allows
you to be faster. And losing toes helps you

325
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,850
to reduce the weight in the distal extremities
and allows you to have a longer stride and

326
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:59,299
a faster stride in open country grasslands
as you evolve away from forests. It's a lovely

327
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:06,020
study. And it fits this type of linear trajectory.
But when you look at horse evolution

328
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,419
you see how, just how many lineages there
are. All these different lineages named based

329
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:18,419
on differences in morphology. Not molecular
biology. Yet. But, it's stirring.

330
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:27,460
So what you've done when you make a story
like that is essentially follow one track

331
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:34,460
through this complex web of history. And tell
a story on that basis of that one track.

332
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:41,279
You go from your Dawn horse following one
track line to the modern horse. And create

333
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:41,529
one

334
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:48,490
linear narrative about all these, all this
complex evolution. And all these failed

335
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,360
pathways, if you want to consider them that.

336
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,960
Yes?

337
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,779
STUDENT: Where do zebras come in.

338
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:00,720
PROFESSOR: Zebras are way up here. Zebras
are members of the genus Equus. This,

339
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,440
very closely related to your domestic, domestic
horse. You have the thing called Equus

340
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,529
Przewalski in Mongolia that's thought to be
the direct ancestor of the modern horse.

341
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:16,100
Zebras are closely related. There's a zebra-like
creature that recently went extinct

342
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,779
called the quagga. And I know the guy today
talking has genetic data from the quagga.

343
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:22,539
So

344
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:25,570
they're just, they're just a horse. Yeah.

345
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,470
STUDENT: [inaudible]

346
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,860
PROFESSOR: Same species as your domestic horse.
The ponies. Yeah, all considered

347
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,510
Equus caballus. Same species as the domestic
horse.

348
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:41,649
So, and these lines that even a diagram like
this connecting all the dots, these are

349
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:48,649
hypotheses about the evolutionary connections.
In reality, just have fossils from a

350
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:55,070
certain time period. You have fossils of,
is that Parahippus here, Pliohippus,

351
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,529
Merychippus. We have fossils that represent
these different types. You may know that

352
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:06,529
they run from 25 to 15 million. But to connect
these up into a story involves further

353
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,360
suppositions.

354
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,360
So we can't naively tell these stories of
linear trajectories. We have to recognize

355
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:23,549
that they're hypotheses built on hypotheses.
And the traditional story of horse evolution

356
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:32,779
is one of gradual change relating to a modern
condition that's the apex of the whole

357
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:36,940
process. The noble horse of today.

358
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,940
And it all culminated in that. Well, it was
a branchy messy process with lots of ins

359
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,279
and outs. And we shouldn't be selective in
our storytelling. We also don't need to

360
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:56,279
necessarily choose between punctuated evolutionary
patterns and gradualistic patterns as

361
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:03,350
being one or the other. Different organisms
might evolve in different ways, according

362
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,600
to

363
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:10,399
their mode and tempo. And even the same organisms,
one lineage might at different times

364
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:18,299
exhibit the different patterns. So as usual
we can't naively just accept one perspective.

365
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:26,629
We need to hold multiple perspectives in mind.
We need to be multifactorial, which will

366
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:33,629
be really true in ecology, in the ecology
section. Ecologists love multiple causality.

367
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:44,479
So true novelties in evolution, true creativity,
that's a lasting problem. How do

368
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:50,009
you get something from nothing? That goes
back to that old philosophical problem. What

369
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:56,379
I'm going to address as one answer is this
phenomenon of tinkering.

370
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:01,390
And the gradual building up of complex neomorphs.
Remember the eye was the problem.

371
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:07,859
An organ of extreme perfection like the eye,
how could it, what good is half of an eye?

372
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:12,079
It couldn't be built by natural selection
step-by-step because half of an eye is no

373
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:12,719
good.

374
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,489
You need the whole thing or nothing.

375
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:24,489
Mollusks show a great example in the world
of living mollusks, the different stages

376
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:32,160
of complexity in eyes that could represent
the stepping-stones along which eyes evolved.

377
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:38,489
Limpets, these little creatures like limpets
or chitons that cling to the rocks down

378
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:44,950
on the, on the ocean shore, they have a type
of eye that just essentially is a series of

379
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:51,950
pigmented cells. So they can perceive light
and dark only. Which is useful. Better than

380
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:58,390
no eye because if a shadow crosses over them
that may be a predator, may be something that

381
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,900
threatens them at least they know that there's
something overhead and maybe they should

382
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,599
cling tighter rather than trying to be active
in moving at that time. So simple pigmented

383
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,089
cells representing an eye are useful and functional.
They don't do what the hawk's eye

384
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:21,089
does. But at least it's positive benefit to
the organism and can be explained as evolving

385
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,569
by natural selection.

386
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:29,059
Organisms like nautiloids. This is a living
creature called a nautiloid, still

387
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:36,059
exists. Well, it has a somewhat more complex
eye that's, functions like a pinhole camera,

388
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:44,979
that has an aperture that can be opened and
closed to allow more or less light in and

389
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:45,229
to

390
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:51,299
give the organism some sense of depth-of-field.
If you know something about the way an

391
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:57,339
aperture functions on a camera. There's even
a step in between that we could have drawn,

392
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:04,299
just forming a cup, an eye cup. On your PDF
I, I have a link which you can look, you can

393
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:10,319
go to for a very entertaining description
of eye evolution to enliven this that's given

394
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:10,569
by

395
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:17,450
Richard Dawkins who's a popular biologist
in an easy to listen to presentation on this

396
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:18,319
subject.

397
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:23,499
Conchs, I mean look at those funny eyes. Starting
to resemble more of what we think

398
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:29,499
of as an eye maybe on these long stalks. Well
they have a lens that not only allows some

399
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:36,249
depth perception but allows a better focus
of the image. So not only can they see depth,

400
00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:42,940
but some clarity of what's moving in front
of them. All steps that are very useful in

401
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:49,940
vision. When you get to the cephalopods, like
quid and octopus and cuttlefish, you have

402
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:50,759
a

403
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:56,450
very complex eye with all the features really
that we have in our eyes, including the

404
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,959
cornea and the lens and the retina. A complex
camera eye like this. But it's differently

405
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:08,959
corrected from ours. It's convergent. It's
convergently evolved on the vertebrate eye.

406
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:12,410
Some day you must save up your money to go
to a place where you can snorkel with

407
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:18,880
squid because you'll, it's an unforgettable
thing when you end up with a school of squid,

408
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,849
cephalopods, and they all turn and look at
you at once with these eyes, it's unbelievable.

409
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:29,599
I mean it's like you're looking at a bunch
of mammals in a watery context and they're

410
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:29,849
all

411
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:34,769
synchronized and changing their colors in
synchrony. Organisms are not thought to be

412
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:35,019
able

413
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,029
to see color. Traditionally that's the notion.
You have a GSI in this course who's

414
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:44,029
studying that right now. He's got some cuttlefish
up in his lab. And he's, he seems to

415
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:50,589
be challenging that notion that these cephalopods
with their complex eyes can't see color.

416
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:55,890
Fascinating little study happening in the
building upstairs.

417
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,940
The hawk's eye, the vertebrate's eye is differently
constructed as I mentioned. It's

418
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,180
actually an inferior construction in many
ways because of the way that the, and I don't

419
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:11,950
know enough about this, but the way that the
photo pigment receptors are constructed,

420
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:18,859
they're reversed from the cephalopod's eye.
And it creates a blind spot in vertebrates

421
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,299
because of the bundling of the nerves at the
back of the eye. A blind spot for the

422
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:28,459
vertebrates that the cephalopods don't have.
So in many ways the cephalopod eye is a

423
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:30,259
superior construction.

424
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:37,259
But why isn't the vertebrate eye better? It's
not the way evolution proceeds by

425
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:44,989
doing the optimum. It works with what's available.
Evolutionary processes can get caught

426
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:51,989
in cul-de-sacs that are irreversible. And
it's one of the great examples for a natural

427
00:39:55,499 --> 00:40:01,309
process here because if you wanted to do this
process ideally, you would construct

428
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:06,289
organisms perfectly and differently. And the
vertebrate eye is an imperfect construction.

429
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:13,289
It's certainly the cephalopod eye can be improved
upon.

430
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,829
I don't have time for this video but I'll
send you a link. It's an introduction to

431
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:25,829
this phenomenon of exaptation. And it describes
pitcher plants well. Pitcher plants are

432
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:34,319
one of these carnivorous plants, right, that
consume insects by, in the case of the

433
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:40,809
pitcher plants, having a watery medium inside
them that the insects fall into. And end up

434
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:47,719
being digested by the plant. A great adaptation
on the part of plants particularly that

435
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:54,719
are living in nitrogen and phosphorus poor
environments.

436
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,449
They can't get their, these essential elements
from the soil. So they get them from

437
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:06,829
these animals that fall in and then fall into
this acidic bath and get digested. The

438
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:10,959
video is even more spectacular because it
shows just what a complex system this is.

439
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:11,209
It's

440
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:15,219
not just the plants that are eating the insects
but there's a little spider that lives in

441
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:22,219
there that steals the food. But in defecating
and digesting these insects also feeds the

442
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:28,739
plant. And then a crab that wants to eat the
spiders and as usual it's a complex story.

443
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:33,739
But the point here is about exaptation. And
the fact that, well what is a pitcher?

444
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:40,739
You guys know your plants, up down, left and
right now. What is, what is this? This --

445
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:48,519
modified leaf, yes. These are modified leaves.
So this organism in needing a capture

446
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:55,519
device hasn't invented a whole new organ for
capturing insects. It's modified leaves.

447
00:41:57,229 --> 00:42:04,229
It's tinkered with stuff it already had. Tinker
Bell, I've learned from my daughter, was,

448
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:11,150
I mean that's in the root, that's in the root
of her name. Tinker Bell is a, was a child

449
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:18,150
who used to work with metal pots and pans
or something like this, and create like, teapots

450
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,609
from them or something. I don't know. But,
would tinker, would use the object at hand

451
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:24,859
to

452
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,479
create new objects. She was Tinker Bell, she
was a tinkerer. It's kind of an old

453
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:33,239
fashioned word that people, saying, oh, you're
just tinkering over there, aren't you Sonny

454
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,910
or something like that, right? No one says
that anymore. But, to tinker, that's the

455
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,150
idea.

456
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,039
And the French made it famous because they
had a term that translates as tinker,

457
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:50,719
called bricoler, B-R-I-C-O-L-E-R. So that's
where it became current in English, from

458
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:57,630
the French translation. Because these French
guys were strong on pointing out that so

459
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:04,249
much of evolution happens through tinkering,
working with what you have. A structure

460
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:11,249
that's evolved for one function originally
is exapted, it's co-opted, it's co-opted for

461
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:12,299
a

462
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:18,430
new function. A structure that's evolved for
one function and becomes co-opted for a new

463
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:23,749
function is called an exaptation.

464
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:29,539
And so much of evolution has happened through
that process. The Venus Flytrap and

465
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:35,880
its capture device is also based on modified
leaves for the same purposes, capturing

466
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,940
insects in nutrient-poor environments.

467
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:46,469
Or as a final example, the topic that's comes
up already, it's so fascinating in a

468
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:53,469
modern context, the relationship of birds.
And specifically now this great synapomorphy

469
00:43:54,349 --> 00:44:01,349
of the avian lineage that is feathers. Feathers,
you can't find feathers on anything else

470
00:44:02,479 --> 00:44:09,479
other than birds and their close relatives.
So what are feathers? Feathers are uniquely

471
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:19,190
constructed for what? For flying with, right?
Well there are a couple of different types

472
00:44:20,279 --> 00:44:26,269
of feather. And the dinosaurs, the early dinosaurs,
and there are several now, there are

473
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:32,209
several nice ones, mostly from China. One
hundred twenty million years from microraptor,

474
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:39,209
125 or so for Sinornithosaurus. Sinosauropteryx,
125, around the same time here. Well

475
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:48,670
preserved in these slabs of material, showing
evidence for feathers on the bodies of these

476
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,459
creatures.

477
00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:54,819
These tend to be the little downy-type feathers,
the down feathers, the fluffy little

478
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:59,890
ones that young birds have, the type that
are good for your sleeping bag or your

479
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:05,400
comforter, because they're particularly insulating
and warm.

480
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,249
Maybe that's why feathers evolved in these
little creatures, to keep them warm?

481
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:18,249
Okay. It's a good possibility given the fact
that you're not seeing the long asymmetrical

482
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:25,289
feathers typically used in flight on these
ancient forms. So see how you have a scenario

483
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:31,959
here whereby you could have downy feathers
evolving in the precursors. And those feathers

484
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:38,959
being exapted for flight in creatures like
Archaeopteryx, the famous transitional organism

485
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:50,680
between dinosaurian reptiles and modern birds.

486
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,190
And there are intervening possibilities with
feathers between insulation and flight

487
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:03,190
too. Because feathers are rich in signaling
possibilities. So they could also be

488
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:10,009
co-opted for patterns in sexual selection.
And even flight after that. A few different

489
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:16,089
scenarios possible to test with the fossil
record and molecular studies potentially.

490
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:19,140
All right. All set for today. Have a nice
week.
