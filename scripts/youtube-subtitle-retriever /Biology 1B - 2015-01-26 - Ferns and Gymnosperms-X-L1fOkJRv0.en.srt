00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:08,650
>> Professor: Morning. I want to remind you
that the labs begin this week. I want to remind

2
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,180
you that the labs begin this week so that
the and your discussions sections also, so

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,730
please make sure you make them. If you are
absent from the first section I think you

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,119
will be dropped from the class so make sure
that you go even if you are planning on changing

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,310
or trying to change sections because that's
the only way we have a recording that you

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,470
are actually in the class by showing up at
the first lab and discussion section. The

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,890
last time I started to talk you about the
origin of plants,the green plants and we spent

8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,160
most of the time talking about the algae.
And we said that the algae and we talked particularly

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,160
about the green algae 
invented a very unusual life cycle and the
life cycle depended upon two different plants,

10
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,640
which were produced successively in a cycle
and the life cycle could not be complete if

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,350
only one of the plants was produced. And we
gave a name to those two plants. One was called

12
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:24,350
the Sporophyte, which we said was 2n, and
the other one was the gametophyte which was

13
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,880
"n", and that these two alternated in the
life cycle to give the life cycle known as

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,520
alternations of generations. Now what is the
relationship of these two organisms to each

15
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,979
other? You're going to you have an opportunity
to see this in the lab, but in some cases

16
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,229
the Sporophyte was bigger than the gametophyte
in the ocean. In some cases the gametophyte

17
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,780
was bigger than the Sporophyte, and in some
cases they were both the same size. And in

18
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,530
the lab you're going to have an opportunity
to view these two different sizes of the plants.

19
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,670
Make sure that you appreciate that the life
cycle that we're going to be talking about

20
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,499
for the rest of the class begin with the green
algae and began with their inventing alternations

21
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:18,939
of generation. Very important point which
once you understand it, is going to carry

22
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:23,709
out through all the rest of the plants that
we talk about in today's class. And, in fact,

23
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:30,709
through the end of the semester. Now while
the algae were inventing the alternation of

24
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:35,700
generation scheme, and we think, as I mentioned
before, that this happened several times.

25
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,040
Other things were going on,so let's put the
eukaryote branch that we put last time on

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,040
the board 
and just for our discussion we'll put animals
up here at the top. And at this point we'll

27
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,620
say this is the origin of the algae. Now during
the first billion years 
the algae were inventing or trying various

28
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:23,099
life cycles, and as I said during this period
of time they reinvented a number of times

29
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,829
the alternations of generations scheme. But
something else was going on during these first

30
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:34,829
billion years. Some of the algae from the
ocean began to move from the ocean to lakes

31
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:42,049
and bogs, so we also had movement to lakes
and to bogs. During this million, this billion

32
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:55,370
years and there were, of course, other changes
happening. About 490 million years ago, about

33
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,790
490 millions years ago after this first billion
years of alga evolution something remarkable

34
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:11,790
happened and that was that an alga left the
lake and bog and moved onto the land. It became

35
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:19,370
whatever it was, the first land plant. Now
in moving from a water environment in the

36
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:25,919
lake or the bog onto the land here we have
an alga. This is a brown alga we talked about

37
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,470
before, and it normally grows in the ocean.
If we were to move onto the land what would

38
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,759
be some problems that we would encounter?
>> Male Student: How to move around.

39
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,559
>> Professor: Okay, how to move around, okay
so

40
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:41,009
>> Male Student: (Inaudible) maintain your
position.

41
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,309
>> Professor: Okay, how to maintain your position.
What else would we encounter. Yes?

42
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:46,819
>> Male Student: (Inaudible)
>> Professor: Pardon me? Water problems. What

43
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:53,819
do you mean by water problems? Okay, water
problems. So the water problems include support.

44
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,810
What other kind of problem would you have
related to water? Yes?

45
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,889
>> Male Student: (Inaudible)
>> Professor: Okay, transport. That's a good

46
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:10,889
one. What else? How about drying out? So it
could dry out. That's a water problem. And

47
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:21,479
going back to the first answer of movement
problems, what about the flagella? How are

48
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:28,479
the gametes getting together? Requires water
for the movement, so fertilization, which

49
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,490
requires water so all of these problems would
be encountered by this alga, or this first

50
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,750
plant which moved onto the land, and these
are problems which the plants had to deal

51
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:51,750
with. Today we think that the plant which
is living which has the most characteristics

52
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,750
of these first plants which moved onto the
land repre is represented by a group of plants

53
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,750
which are still around today, which are known
as the Bryophytes. These plants, we believe

54
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,819
are the closest living relatives to what the
first land plant, we think look like. The

55
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:19,819
Bryophytes are better known to you as the
mosses and the liverworts. And I'd like to

56
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,669
spend a little time talking about the Bryophytes.
First of all, the Bryophytes are not very

57
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:33,409
significant with regard to the economy, except
with one respect. One percent of the earth's

58
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:40,409
surface is covered with peat bogs and peat
is frequently, especially in poor countries,

59
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,780
mined or cut off and used to heat homes. So
in this respect the Bryophytes are important.

60
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,949
Now let's spend a little bit of time looking
at the Bryophytes. We said that the problems

61
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,789
that the plants moving onto the land would
encounter are these problems over here, and

62
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:04,659
we now have the Bryophytes which we said are
close relatives or a close, we think, relatives

63
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,979
as far as some of their characteristics to
what the first land plants were like. So what

64
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,749
do the Bryophytes look like? How do they deal
with this particular problem? Well, first

65
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:20,749
of all, the Bryophytes do not have a system
for transporting water or nutrients. In the

66
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:40,020
ocean the algae is completely surrounded by
water and nutrients so there's no reason for

67
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,379
it to develop a transport system. And the
Bryophytes have not developed a transport

68
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:51,009
system. Like the algae, they have no way of
moving liquids and nutrient great distances,

69
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:58,009
and so as a consequence the Bryophytes have
remained small. And not only have they remained

70
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,439
small but if you come up here and look at
the pots that the Bryophytes have, and I'll

71
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,169
also show you pictures of them, you will find
that they are flat against the earth. They

72
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:17,110
are pressed to the earth. In that way they
can absorb water and nutrients directly from

73
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,110
the soil directly beneath them and not have
worry about transporting the water great distances.

74
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,759
So the Bryophytes have remained small means
they don't have to worry about a transport

75
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,690
system. Because they're small, they don't
have to worry about support because they're

76
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,960
flat on the ground; and now we want to consider
these other two aspects, how the Bryophytes

77
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,960
have dealt with drying out and fertilization.
The Bryophytes live in areas if we look at

78
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,960
them and this is the reason we ask you colle
to collect them that are periodically moist,

79
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,500
areas that are periodically moist. Given that
they live in areas that are periodically moist

80
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,620
they have retained the flagellated sperm,
and flagellated gametes. So you might say

81
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,620
they live in the areas because they have retained
flagellated gametes. This allows the gametes

82
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,890
to get together when they are ready and when
there is water available for fertilization

83
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:35,890
to occur. Now let's talk a little bit about
the Bryophyte life cycle and some of the characteristics.

84
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,390
This large Bryophyte plant which I have here
and for those who come up or look at the slides

85
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,750
later on, this moss plant, this is a liverwort
in my left hand, and a moss in my right hand.

86
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,160
Both of these plants, which you see here are
the gametophyte. In the bryophytes the gametophyte

87
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:00,160
is dominant. It is the largest and it is photosynthetic.
So when the first land plants moved onto the

88
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:22,540
land they had a choice of taking the Sporophyte
and making it dominant or making it exactly

89
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,070
the same size as the gametophyte, and the
choice was made for the Bryophytes to make

90
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,960
the gametophyte dominant. We don't know what
the selective pressures were that involved

91
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,340
making that choice. Now, let's look a little
bit at the life cycle of the Bryophyte and

92
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:45,210
talk a bit about how some of these necessary
adaptations figure into the life cycle. First

93
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:52,210
of all, the Bryophytes show alternations 
of generations. They have a gametophyte which
I just showed you and a Sporophyte to complete

94
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:16,670
the life cycle, just as you've seen before,
nothing new. Now let's talk about an example

95
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,910
of the life cycle of a bryophyte and put in
some of these events which we have here on

96
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,200
the board on the right, and talk to you about
some of these events which we have the plant

97
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,920
having to deal with once it moves onto the
the land. And for this discussion I'm going

98
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,920
to put on a moss, the life cycle of a moss
and we'll have two different moss plants,

99
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:52,310
so these are two different moss plants. They
are green and they're free living. So both

100
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:04,330
of these moss plants are 
the gametophyte generation. And for our discussion
today we're going to make a statement that

101
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,360
one of the plants is female, that is produces
the female gamete, and one of the plants is

102
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,360
male that produces the male gamete. Now let's
talk about how these plants, which grow in

103
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:35,660
periodically moist areas, manage their life
cycle. The male gamete has to get over to

104
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,980
the female or the female has to get over to
the male; but in this case it's male going

105
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,780
to the female. We said that the gametes are
flagellated and yet these organisms grow on

106
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:54,450
the land. How is it that water is available
to allow fertilization to occur? And the answer

107
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,300
is, and should be obvious from the collections
that many of you made today or over the weekend,

108
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,370
is that water occasionally comes, for example,
when it rains or when there is a periodic

109
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,800
flooding. There's water available and the
gametes therefore can get together. The problem

110
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,080
is that the plant never knows when water is
going to come and so if it makes the gametes,

111
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,550
the gametes risk drying out waiting for the
water to come. And so what the plant has done

112
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,300
and this is the innovation that the Bryophytes
have done in moving onto the land is they

113
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:34,240
have made two structures to protect the gametes
until water comes. And the structure which

114
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,240
was made in the female is called the archegonium.
It protects the egg. And the structure which

115
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,880
was made in the male is called the antheridium,
and it protects the sperm. So here we have

116
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:09,450
these two plants where we're calling a male
and the female plant with their gametes already

117
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:16,190
made waiting for water whether it's rain or
flooding or whatever to occur to allow the

118
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:23,190
gametes to get together. So let's make the
female gametophyte and she has an egg up here

119
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:31,760
in the archegonium, and then gametes, we believe,
can move from the male to the female in the

120
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:41,180
number of ways through the water. The female
may secrete a pheromone. No one is for sure

121
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,900
about that, but the way the sperm swim toward
the female, we believe it is their detractant.

122
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:53,710
It's also possible that rain water might splash
the male gamete over to the female gamete.

123
00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:00,710
When this occurs if we look inside here is
the archegonium, here is the egg, and here

124
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:12,010
is the male gamete. So at this point we can
get fertilization occurring when these two

125
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:23,530
meet together. Let me put it on this board
up here, put that up for you. Once fertilization

126
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,950
occurs, and let's remind ourselves where it's
occurring. Here is the gametophyte. Here is

127
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:39,950
where fertilization occurs here. If we wait
for some time what we find is something remarkable

128
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,200
happening and you can see this when you go
outside and you look at the moss. Here is

129
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,200
the gametophyte which is green and photosynthetic,
and out of the tip of the gametophyte from

130
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,840
the new embryo, from the new embryo grows
the new Sporophyte, the new Sporophyte. Through

131
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:18,350
meiosis it makes spores and they grow into
new gametophytes. So notice in the Bryophytes

132
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:39,190
that the gametophyte is independent whereas
the Sporophyte is totally depending on the

133
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,400
gametophyte. So all of its food, all of its
nutrition, all of its water it gets from the

134
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,770
gametophyte. It is never free living and this
is an important point. In the Bryophytes the

135
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:21,230
gametophyte is free living and in the Sporophytes
are not free living. They are parasites essentially

136
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,430
on that gametophyte but they still show the
alternations of generation life cycle. Very

137
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,470
important for you to get this in you mind.
We look at the Bryophytes in the lab, and

138
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,170
there are some examples up here in the front
if you time after lecture if you have time.

139
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,620
Now because the Bryophytes needed water during
some portion of their life cycle and because

140
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,550
they didn't have roots and a transport system
they basically remained confined, as I said,

141
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,290
to areas which were periodically moist, areas
that were bogs and swamps. They couldn't really

142
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,240
colonize a great deal of the earth's surface
so the next evolutionary advance which comes

143
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,670
along to move the plants into other areas
of the earth's surface involves the development

144
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:09,670
of a transport system. Or as it's referred
to in your book, and as we will talk about

145
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:25,780
here, a vascular system. This vascular system
consist of special cell types and we're going

146
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,890
to talk about them a little later in the class
which are involved in the movement of water

147
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:39,400
and nutrients. But for our discussion today
let's just talk about vascular system without

148
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,040
identifying the cell type. We believe that
this transport system develops somewhere between

149
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,040
387 and 408 million years ago to produce the
vascular plants. Now for our discussion today

150
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:07,260
I'd like to make division of the vascular
plants, that is vascular plants with seeds

151
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,320
and vascular plants without seeds. And I'd
like to begin by talking about, first, vascular

152
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,190
plants without seeds, that is plants which
have a transport system which allows them

153
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:31,140
to become big and to move as we now know into
almost every environment on the earth. These

154
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:38,140
vascular plants now are about 250,000 species.
And of these 250,000 species about 12,000

155
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,790
are plants without seeds, vascular plants
without seeds. The first group then we will

156
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:57,050
consider are the seedless vascular plants
and perhaps the best example that's most familiar

157
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:04,050
to most of you of a seedless vascular plant
are the ferns. They have a transport system,

158
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,160
but they don't produce seeds. And I have up
here in front a couple of examples of ferns

159
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,800
and you're going to see them in the lab. The
distinguishing feature of the ferns for most

160
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,800
of you is this large often very showy leathery
leaf. This large showy leathery leaf is called

161
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:38,670
a frond. When you look at a plant with fronds,
and this is a remarkable puzzle; when you

162
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,000
look at a fern plant with fronds, given that
the ferns probably evolved from something

163
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,630
which was a Bryophyte, perhaps ancestor maybe
not, instead of this being a gametophyte as

164
00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:00,630
it is in the bryophytes, this is the Sporophyte.
So in the ferns, fronds are part of the Sporophyte.

165
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,590
So when you look at a fern outside all of
the ferns that you see growing, the ones that

166
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,500
you might have around your home or in your
dorm room, they are all Sporophytes. This

167
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,710
is a twoend generation. Now if you turn the
frond over, and there are various examples

168
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,430
upfront here, and you look at the under side
of a frond you will see some of these have

169
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,809
dots on them like this one over here, dots
on the under side of the frond. What are these

170
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,680
dots? One student thought that it was a disease
and she kept trying to clean them up. They

171
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:43,680
are not a disease. These dots represent spores
so under the frond spores are produced. And

172
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,880
they're made inside of a protective structure
called a sporangium, just call this sporangium,

173
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,680
so if you look at the under side of these
leaves you have these protective structures

174
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,360
and this has to be done under the microscope
and inside these protective structures spores

175
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,160
are being made. So if this is the two end
generation, that is, this is the Sporophyte

176
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:37,160
generation and the Sporophyte is making spores,
that means meiosis has to occur. This is an

177
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,460
important point. Meiosis has to occur on the
under side of these fronds. And because these

178
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:53,780
leaves, these fronds bear spores on them they
are called sporophylls where meiosis occurs.

179
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:11,540
Very important point. So I've shown you now
the diploid, the Sporophyte generation and

180
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:19,940
I've told you that the Sporophyte generation,
as you might expect, makes spores. And this

181
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,940
is a green plant which had as its ancestor
a green alga, and like the Bryophytes it also

182
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,200
inherited from the green algae alternation
of generations life cycle. So every fern,

183
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,420
which is growing outside in order for it to
complete its life cycle has to make another

184
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:59,679
plant, has to make a gametophyte. What do
the gametophytes and ferns look like? Have

185
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,750
any of you ever seen the gametophyte of a
fern? Well, you're going to look at them in

186
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,990
the lab and I'm going to show you slides of
them, but I also have some gametophytes up

187
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:14,990
here in front. They are small, green plants.
They live independently, and they undergo

188
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,120
photosynthesis so this plant here, in fact,
there are many of these plants here in this

189
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,880
petri dish and this plant here alternate in
the life cycle in order for the fern to complete

190
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,880
its life cycle if you're careful and you go
and you look under a fern perhaps growing

191
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,210
in undisturbed wooded forest, you will be
able to find small gametophytes growing at

192
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,950
the base of that fern. Those small the gametophytes
came from the spores produced by the Sporophyte

193
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,160
which usually much larger and growing above
the gametophyte. So let's look at the life

194
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:57,160
cycle now of a typical fern with these two
plants; the Sporophyte and the gametophyte,

195
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,929
and let's begin with the Sporophyte. This
plant here which is made up of sporophylls

196
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:12,929
and is making spores. So here we have the
2n, Sporophyte, 2N sporophyte. It makes spores

197
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,950
which I've just said is made on the under
side of the leaf through the process of meiosis.

198
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:30,950
These spores are "n" because meiosis has occurred.
Spores become gametophytes. Same thing that

199
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,200
you saw before going back to the algae may
become gametophytes, which are also n. Now

200
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:48,490
what does the fern gametophyte look like?
I told you it was green, it's tiny maybe a

201
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:55,490
centimeter or less in size and undergoes photosynthesis,
that is free living. A typical gametophyte

202
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:03,059
although this is stereo typical is kind of
heart shaped, a gametophyte. This is "n" remember.

203
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,170
What does a gametophyte make? Gametophyte
make gametes. Where are the gametes made on

204
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:17,290
this gametophyte? Well, if we look carefully
on typical gametophytes, we'll find two areas

205
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:24,290
where the gametes are made. We have the female
gametes. And they're made in a structure which

206
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:33,550
the Bryophytes originated, in the archegonium,
and we have the male gametes in the antheridium.

207
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:51,710
Now typically what happens and a lot of people
who are interested in population biology spend

208
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,600
a lot of time studying gametophytes. Typically
what happens is the gametophyte first makes

209
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:08,120
the female gamete or the egg, and it waits
for gamete from a male to come from another

210
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,470
gametophyte, someplace else, so that it can
outcross, but if it doesn't get fertilized

211
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:21,470
after some period of time, it will make its
own gametes, male gametes here and self fertilize.

212
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:28,250
In that way you have not lost the plant although
you have not created any new genetic material,

213
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:34,630
because you're fertilizing essentially with
your same DNA so we have now an archegonium,

214
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:41,630
and inside let's say that this is the gametophyte
here, here is archegonium, here we have the

215
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:53,870
new embryo. That is the new 2n Sporophyte.
And if you look carefully outside and you're

216
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:07,610
lucky what you will see is you will find the
gametophyte, but you will find apparently

217
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:14,610
it looks like it's growing on the gametophyte.
You will find a new Sporophyte 
growing out. This new Sporophyte whichos growing

218
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:32,330
out is coming from the is coming from the
archegonium, and it is now, for a period of

219
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:39,270
time, until it becomes independent, living
off of the gametophyte. It is essentially

220
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:46,270
parasitizing the gametophyte, but in the ferns,
the gametophytes and the Sporophytes are independent.

221
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:53,929
So this is an important point. They are both
free living, both photosynthetic, a very important

222
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,720
point. Let's now look at some of the pictures
of the Bryophytes and of the fern, gametophytes.

223
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:27,049
Let's see if I can do this here. There we
go. So here is a pot of moss, and what you

224
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:35,010
see growing up from the moss is the Sporophyte.
It is green, but because it is green shouldn't

225
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,250
assume that it is independent. It still gets
most of its food, as you can see from the

226
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:44,700
next slide, from the haploid gametophyte,
which is the main photosynthetic organism.

227
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,040
These Sporophytes are growing up from archegonium
which had been fertilized and then this Sporophyte

228
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:55,460
grows up, meiosis occurs here, spores produced
to make more of these plants. The liverworts

229
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,980
now, as I said, are flat have no roots, are
pressed to the surface of the soil and they

230
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,679
can directly absorb nutrients and not have
to transport them over great distances. The

231
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,740
liverworts which you will see in lab are quite
complex in structure and this dried specimen

232
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,920
in the next slide will show you these complex
structures. This is all gametophyte tissue.

233
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,200
The only time you will see the Sporophyte
is if you look under the arms of one one of

234
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,380
these gametophyte looks like umbrella you
will see little yellow structures. This is

235
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,380
the other plant growing underneath that particular
gametophyte. It is its entire life is spent

236
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:38,290
there. It gets all of its food and it's not
independent. Here is sphagnum moss. It is

237
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:44,200
the moss that makes up the peat bogs and which
is self important in some cultures. Here is

238
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,740
the Sporophyte now of the fern. These are
the sporophylls or fronds and on the underr

239
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,850
side of these fronds spores are being produced,
they will fall to the ground, germinate and

240
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,250
grow into gametophytes, and if we look at
the under side of the frond, we'll see these

241
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,570
dots. These dots are actually many, many sporangia
as you can see more in a high powered slide

242
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,940
here. Each of these dots is a sporangium,
and inside each sporangia which is shown in

243
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:14,940
a high powered here are the many, many spores
maybe 50 to 100 spores inside of each sporangium.

244
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:20,020
If we let the spores germinate they grow into
these gametophytes. These haploid plants,

245
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,919
photosynthetic, this has to be produced for
the fern to complete its life cycle. And,

246
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,669
again, to give an idea of the size this is
a typically test tube and here are four or

247
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:34,140
five gametophytes, photosynthetic growing
inside the test tube. This slide over here

248
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,470
now illustrates the point that in the ferns
although we produce, we have antheridium and

249
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,919
although they are free living, that the only
time the male gametes are released is when

250
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,919
there's water so ferns still require some
water because their gametes are flagellated.

251
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:57,860
So this is something that they have retained
from their alga ancestors and from their Bryophytes.

252
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,860
They still require water, and if we look carefully
at the gametophyte we will see that in different

253
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:11,410
areas of the gametophytes we have archegonium,
and antheridium, and here is an archegonium,

254
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,730
and the gametophyte is below. Here is the
egg, and here is male gamete just prior to

255
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,880
fertilization occurring. Once this fertilization
occurs you have a new embryo here. And this

256
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,669
next slide shows you the gametophyte, this
heart shaped gametophyte and growing out of

257
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:32,380
the archegonium the heart shaped gametophyte
is the new Sporophyte, the new plant. This

258
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:36,890
new plant then is the same thing that we have
in here in front, will go on and make spores

259
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:42,010
again. Now before we leave this slide I want
to make a point to you, and that point is

260
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:49,010
here, that the gametophyte is getting smaller,
and as it gets smaller there are consequences

261
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:54,150
and the main consequence is that there's less
tissue to make up the archegonium and the

262
00:32:54,150 --> 00:33:01,090
antheridium, less tissue to prevent the gametes
from drying out. And so the next evolutionary

263
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:07,860
advance which occurs in the plants is the
development of more structures to protect

264
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,960
the developing gametes, and this next evolutionary
advance which we're going to talk about now

265
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,960
comes from the next group of plants which
have evolved from, we believe, a fern ancestor.

266
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:29,910
So let's talk about that next group of plants
which we think has evolved from a fern ancestor.

267
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:36,910
See if it works. Well, we'll see. I don't
know if I can turn the lights out or you.

268
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:46,100
I guess it doesn't want to come one here.
Here we go. Thank you. Okay. About, uh, oh,

269
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:56,020
let's say about 360 millions years ago the
next advance to protect the developing gametes

270
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:02,000
occurred, we think evolutionary speaking,
and that next advance was the development

271
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,000
of the seed, next advance to protect the gametes.
And this occurred, we think about 360 million

272
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:29,149
years ago. Dates are not that important. Some
of you can memorize them if you would like

273
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:36,149
to. At this time the first group of seed plants
was formed but it was not until about 280

274
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:48,470
to 250 millions years ago seed plants became
favored in the environment. And that was because

275
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,440
the earth was subjected to extensive periods
of glaciation dryness, and therefore anything

276
00:34:56,809 --> 00:35:03,049
that could protect the gametes would be favored.
So about 250 to 280 million years ago the

277
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:08,999
seed plants began to expand and to take over
the surface of the earth, and at this time

278
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:13,410
one of the first groups of seed plants which
developed is a group which you know of as

279
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:20,410
conifers or cone bearing plants. They are
also known as gymnosperms and we'll go back

280
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:34,910
to this term in a moment. Cone bearing plants
are familiar to you. They are the pine trees,

281
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,880
the redwoods; all the plants which make these
very large and often showy cones which generically

282
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,910
we call pine cones. Now in order for you to
appreciate what this pine cone is, I want

283
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:03,910
to step back for a moment and just talk about
what a tree is. Like the fern, in which the

284
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:12,339
primary generation that we see is the Sporophyte
when you look at a conifer or a gymnosperm

285
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:19,339
the primary generation is also the Sporophyte.
But like the ferns and the algae and the Bryophytes,

286
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:27,979
the gymnosperms show alternation of generations,
that is, the have to produce another plant

287
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:33,019
and the production of this other plant is
linked to the formation of the seed. We'll

288
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:40,019
talk about that in one moment. Now let's spend
a few minutes talking about this cone. I also

289
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:46,859
said that the conifers or cone bearing plants
can be called gymnosperms. This term gymnosperm

290
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:53,859
translates into naked seed. And I'd like you
all just to spend a moment and look at me

291
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,249
for a second while I do this demonstration.
Here is a cone from the gymnosperm and what

292
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:05,690
I'm going to do is take this, the scales have
opened up, take this cone and turn it upside

293
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:12,420
down. If I turn it upside down the seeds fall
out directly. These seeds are naked. They

294
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,999
are not surrounded by any other protective
structure than the scale on the outside. Hence

295
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:24,720
the term gymnosperm. Now let's talk a little
bit more about the cone and therefore I will

296
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,130
talk about the other generation and where
the seed comes from. Where does thia cone

297
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:35,950
from, what is this cone, and how does it figure
into the life cycle of the ferns? What I'd

298
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:42,950
like you to do isto imagine as many biologists
now believe that the first gymnosperms came

299
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:49,799
or evolved from a now extinct fern ancestor.
What I'd like you to do is to take these sporophylls

300
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:56,799
that make up this fern and collapse them down
into a cone and what the cones represents,

301
00:37:57,799 --> 00:38:04,799
basically, is a collection of sporophylls,
a collection of sporophylls make up this cone.

302
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:15,259
So a cone represents a collection 

303
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:36,180
of sporophylls. So if this cone is a collection
of sporophylls and is being produced by the

304
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:48,900
2n, the Sporophyte generation, what is associated
with the sporophylls? Just like in the ferns,

305
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:57,329
what is associated with this collection of
sporophylls, is that it makes spores. So on

306
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:08,150
each of these scales or woody structures that
you see here which we're calling a sporophyll,

307
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:15,849
spores are made. That means meiosis occurs.
So in the gymnosperms we produce this large

308
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,869
cone, but if you look carefully and all of
you, I guarantee are familiar with the effects

309
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:38,460
of the next thing I'm going to say, although
may not realize it. If you also look carefully

310
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,789
at a gymnosperm you will find tiny cones.
These tiny cones, again, are made up of a

311
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:48,920
collection of sporophylls, and these tiny
cones produce something which bothers many

312
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:55,920
of you. These tiny cones produce pollen so
pollen is produced by one cone I'll write

313
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:04,099
this down for you and eggs are produced by
the other cone. So the large cone makes an

314
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,880
egg or the female gamete and this female gamete
is given a special name. It is called a it

315
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:36,700
comes from, put it this way, it comes from
a spore and we give this spore to differentiate

316
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,839
it from the male, which I'll draw in a moment.
We give this spore a special name. We call

317
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,839
it a megaspore and this megaspore is made
inside just like on the ferns of a sporangium,

318
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:02,319
nothing new, and we call it a megasporangium.
How about the male? So in the male over here

319
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:19,390
we also have a cone. It makes the male gamete
but if we work backwards, the male gamete

320
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:28,069
comes from a male gametophyte which comes
from a spore, and to distinguish this spore

321
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:45,910
from the megaspore we call it a microspore.
The microspore is pollen. That's what pollen

322
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:56,029
is, a microspore and this is made inside of
a microsporangium. So here we have a gymnosperm

323
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:12,569
and on this gymnosperm of Sporophyte. We can
have both cones present; the male cones and

324
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:19,569
the female cones or they can also be on separate
trees, but in any event the microspores have

325
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:26,269
to get to the female cones in order for fertilization
to occur. How does this happen? The trees

326
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:32,979
are growing up in the air. There's no water
around to allow the sperm to travel so in

327
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:39,979
the gymnosperms we have lost fertile� we've
lost flagella, and lost the antheridium. So

328
00:42:53,549 --> 00:43:00,420
how do the male gametes get to the female?
How does it happen? It happens by the wind.

329
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:06,319
This is pollination. The wind carries the
male gametes or the pollen grains to the female

330
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:13,109
cone for fertilization to occur. Now the wind
is a very capricious sort of guide carrying

331
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:17,309
pollen. Maybe it carries it, maybe it doesn't.
That means that you have to make a lot of

332
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:22,989
pollen because it only occurs, fertilization
only occurs by chance, so you have to make

333
00:43:22,989 --> 00:43:28,130
in wind pollenated organism like these gymnosperms
you have to make, it's estimated, a million

334
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:33,609
pollen grains for each successful fertilization.
A large number that are wasted. But by the

335
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:40,609
large numbers you ensure some fertilization.
Now let's briefly look at the life cycle of

336
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:49,339
the gymnosperms, and we'll begin by dividing
the life cycle based on the cone, and I'd

337
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:57,829
like to start on the right board here with
the male cone. And the male cone, just like

338
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,680
the female cone, consists of scales which
are sporophylls. Through the process of meiosis

339
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:18,319
and you're going to see this more in the lab,
we make the pollen which is the microspore

340
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:30,049
which is "n". That pollen is waiting to be
shed. It is ready to travel to the female

341
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:37,049
gamete. Now let's look at the female cone.
And what I'm going to just do for the female

342
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:46,380
cone is to draw one scale, one scale of the
female cone. If we look carefully on the scale

343
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:56,450
what we would find, first of all, is the megasporangium.
We talked about it. Inside we would have the

344
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:08,549
megaspore. And now if we've waited for some
time on the scale again, we would have, inside

345
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:21,259
this megasporangium, inside the megasporangium,
we would have the female megagametophyte.

346
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:34,869
And if you're unclear how this happens just
think back to what happens in the ferns. A

347
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,390
spore develops into a gametophyte. And in
this case we say it develops into a megagametophyte

348
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:49,390
and this then makes the egg. So we'll put
the scale up here again. Here we have the

349
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:59,079
megasporangium. Here we have the mature female
gametophyte and if it's mature it means it's

350
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:15,910
making the egg, so here it has an archegonium,
and here is the egg. So on the scales of this

351
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:31,789
cone we have the female gamete which is the
egg, and pollen then travels via the wind

352
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:37,609
from the male cones and fertilization occurs,
and you're going to see more about this in

353
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:44,609
the lab. Now an important point which I want
to make for you is that we want to look a

354
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:52,779
little more closely about how the seed develops,
and so if we look at what has gone on, on

355
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:59,690
the female scale, this is the origin of the
seed, a really remarkable process which we

356
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:06,690
don't understand. Let's draw that scale again.
Here is the megasporangium. Here is the megagametophyte

357
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:26,269
now. Or just think of it as the gametophyte
if you don't want to put the word mega on

358
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:34,959
there, megagametophyte. And here is the new
embryo or the new Sporophyte. This is with

359
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:47,440
time. Now where does the seed come from? The
seed comes from a totally new structure which

360
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:54,089
has been elaborated to protect the gametes
and that new structure grows up around the

361
00:47:54,089 --> 00:48:01,089
wall of the megasporangium, and that new structure
is the seed coat. And so we can define a seed

362
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:15,019
now and this is important for you to understand
where the definition comes from. We can say

363
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:22,019
that a seed at its grossest level is a megasporangium
surrounded by what will become the seed coat.

364
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,640
So if we just reemphasize the changes that
have occurred in moving from the ferns to

365
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:08,920
the gymnosperms, the first simple changes
that we have lost, antheridium, no more flagellated

366
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:22,930
sperm. There are a couple of exceptions, but
for our purposes,and the gametophyte is no

367
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:39,519
longer free living 
and totally dependent on the mom's sporophyte.
What have we retained? The most important

368
00:49:59,979 --> 00:50:03,359
thing that we have retained, and you should
be keeping this straight in mind, is that

369
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,719
we retained alternations of generation of
life cycle. We have two generations and that's

370
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:15,479
something that goes back to the algae. We
still retain an archegonium. And we still,

371
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:20,749
of course, have an egg. Okay, have a good
time in today's lab and I'll see you in the

372
00:50:20,749 --> 00:50:27,749
afternoons morning when I come to your lab.
