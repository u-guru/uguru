He started cooking alongside his mother at age 4 preparing various savory dishes such as Hungarian Paprikash and Coq Au Vin as well as numerous different pastries.  He started in the restaurant business at age 17 and in professional kitchens shortly after.  With strict training under two Sicilian chefs for the first three years he generated even a greater palate and understanding of the culinary world.  Matthew then worked under Johnny Monis (Chef Geoffs D.C., presently the Chef/Owner of Komi in D.C and a former James Beard nominee.)  He then moved to Seattle where he reopened Blue Onion Bistro as the Executive Chef. After 10 years enveloped in the business he moved to San Francisco to get his formal education at California Culinary Academy. His love of Japanese cuisine led him to help open Yuzu as the Executive Chef training alongside master sushi chef Hiro Hashinomoto.  He then left to gain more understanding of the seasonality and locality of the Bay Area working for Chef Steven Levine (Cosmopolitan).  Matthew is classically trained in Mediterranean, French, and Japanese cuisine with a strong focus on Californian-Mediterranean.","bio_quote":"I've been cooking since I was 4 years old, at my mom's side.

I grew up in a household where we spent much of the time in the kitchen watching my mom cook. In a lot of ways, I think it played a pivotal role in me deciding to go to culinary school.\r\n\r\nI attended Utah Valley University, concurrently doing a culinary internship at The Canyons Ski Resort in Park City, Utah. Between school and my internship, it was an amazing way to get my foot in the door, and expose myself to a ton of things in a short period of time. At the end of my internship I stayed on at The Canyons until the close of the winter season, taking that time  to apply my recently acquired skill sets. \r\n\r\nAfter that I took a job working with Chef Ryker Brown at Promontory Ranch Club in Park City, Utah. Looking back, I see this as a job that was one of the most influential in my career. Ryker became my mentor and he gave me an appreciation for cooking food that is simple, yet refined. It was then that I realized I also wanted to run my own kitchen before the time I was 25 years old. I learned as much as I could, and when the time was right I moved back to the Bay Area to accomplish my goal.\r\n\r\nOver the past 6 years I have worked with some great chefs including Shane Mcnalley Executive Chef of Healdsburg's Chalkboard Bistro, and Beau Burroughs Chef of Dream Farm Restaurant in San Anselmo. For the past 3 and a half years though, I accomplished my goal and headed up my own kitchen at 123 Bolinas in Fairfax, CA. There I was given an amazing opportunity by Dominic Phillips, James Gregory, and Jacquelyn and Jeff Mahaney to get in touch with the local food scene, and put out a menu that highlights the spectacular food that is grown and produced right in our backyard. It's an experience that I'm taking a lot away from and looking forward to sharing with many onboard with Munchery.

She never taught me to cook, she taught me to eat well and fresh, and what is cooking without the pleasure of eating anyways? I never contemplated the idea of becoming a Chef (truth be told, sometimes I still don't believe it) when I first arrived to San Francisco at age 18, however, by age 21 I was working at Enrico's Sidewalk Cafe in North Beach. At that time, San Francisco was a huge world packed in a tiny city, and I felt I could do anything. I consider myself a lucky person for working with so many talented cooks and chefs along the way, at places like Enrico's, Boulevard, Cosmopolitan, Pomelo, etc. Then, life gave me a chance to search back into my roots when 8 years ago, the owners of Limon Restaurant hired me and eventually allowed me to help design their menu and oversee their kitchen. Together, we gave birth to the concept of Limon Rotisserie and felt truly blessed for being able to share a bit of Peruvian Cuisine with the city.

In 1980, while finishing college, he was hired as a cellar master and sommelier in Great Britain. There he was responsible for assisting customers with selections and keeping the wine cellar fully stocked at an upscale restaurant in Newcastle. \r\n \r\nUpon his return to the United States a year later, he was hired by Bill Traverso, a Sonoma and Napa area wine icon. He worked alongside of Bill at Traverso's Gourmet Foods and Wines in Santa Rosa for 12 years learning many aspects of the wine world through Bill.  \r\n \r\nHe then took a wine buying position at Molesberry Market, a chain of 5 grocery stores and worked there for several year. In 1996 Brian went to work for Glenn Segale at The Wine Spectrum as their domestic/international wine buyer.  From this position, he built a bridge to Europe and purchased wine directly from distributors and wineries in overseas. In 2000, he started his own Retail/ Distribution/ Import business called Vino Veritas, which evolved into B&R Wines and finally Cellar Searchers. \r\n \r\nThroughout his career and still to this day, Brian keeps up with the trade taking many classes ranging from sensory perception to the art of making wine. He has distributed wines for top wineries including Abreu, Rivers Marie, Morlet, Staglin, Aubert, Whetstone, Kesner, Native 9, Scherrer to name a few.
